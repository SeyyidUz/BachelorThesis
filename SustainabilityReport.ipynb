        "* String conversion: Converting the input to a string format ensures consistency and compatibility during subsequent processing tasks.\n",
        "* Lowercase conversion: Transforming all text to lowercase serves as a simple normalization step, reducing the complexity and variability of the input data.\n",
        "* Unicode decoding: Removing diacritics (e.g., accented characters) and normalizing the text encoding mitigates potential discrepancies arising from different encoding formats.\n",
        "* URL and email address removal: Eliminating URLs and email addresses reduces noise in the dataset, as these elements do not contribute valuable information for the analysis.\n",
        "* Extra whitespace removal: Eradicating extra whitespaces improves text analysis and tokenization by ensuring that only meaningful spaces are retained.\n",
        "* Contact detail removal: Excluding phone numbers, contact person strings, and social media references further minimizes noise in the dataset, honing the focus on relevant text.\n",
        "* Table of contents removal: Discarding the table of contents enhances the data quality by eliminating repetitive and non-essential information.\n",
        "* Named entity removal: Employing the spaCy model to remove human names and other named entities optimizes the text for analysis and modeling by concentrating on pertinent content.\n",
        "* Abbreviation expansion: Utilizing the contractions library and custom functions with regular expressions, common and uncommon abbreviations are expanded to improve text interpretation.\n",
        "* Special character elimination: Excluding all special characters, except punctuation, refines the input data. Retaining punctuation is necessary for accurate sentence tokenization and removed after sentence tokenization..\n",
        "* Tokenization and lemmatization: Tokenizing words and sentences, and subsequently lemmatizing words using the WordNetLemmatizer from nltk, streamlines the text and reduces morphological variations.\n",
        "* Stopword removal: Customizing the nltk stopwords list by adding or removing specific stopwords enables more precise and tailored text analysis.\n",
        "* Part-of-speech (POS) tagging: Assigning POS tags to words and sentences enhances the text representation by providing additional linguistic information, which may be beneficial for subsequent analysis and modeling tasks.\n",

people have died worldwide and several hundred million have lost their jobs. the virus has turned the reality of countless com- panies, employees and their families upside down, and and its employees are no exception. at the same time, the pandemic is a setback for sustainable development. in addition to the health risks, the fight against hunger and inequality throughout the world has been massively impeded by covid-19. nevertheless, i do find it encouraging that the major issues of climate change and the growing world population are still given the priority they deserve. the topic of sustainability was only briefly su- perseded by covid-19 and remains at the top of the global agenda. experts agree that the recovery following the pan- demic must take into account the ecological limits of the planet. for , 2020 was also the first year of our new sustaina- bility strategy, with which we have set ambitious social and ecological targets aligned to the sustainable development goals (sdgs) of the united nations. this report will demon- strate just how far we've come in this respect. to be honest, i'm very proud of the progress we've made in such a histori- cally challenging year: // we aligned the variable compensation of the board of management and managerial employees to the sustain- ability targets. // we established a specific timetable for all sustainability targets through 2030 and provided it with auditable in- dicators. // we created an external sustainability council comprising leading experts who now engage in regular dialogue with the board of management. // the science based targets initiative audited our climate protection targets and confirmed that is helping to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees celsius and fulfill the paris agreement. in addition, we have committed to the climate target of \"net zero emissions\" by 2050. // we aim to increase the proportion of women in top management to at least 33 percent by 2025 and to 50 percent by 2030. in the implementation of our sustainability strategy, we are focusing on transparency and continuity. we say what we do, and we do what we say. above all, however, we regard sus- tainability not as an additional activity, but rather as a core element of our strategic and normative alignment. ceo the opposite of that - a sustainability strategy based above all on sacrifice and restrictions - would fail doubly because it neither leads to sufficient ecological improvements nor meets with the necessary societal acceptance. i am con- vinced that sustainable development for what is already a world population of just under eight billion people can only succeed through a market economy system. with the right incentives, this also means that companies can only be suc- cessful if they truly operate sustainably. furthermore, i believe that 's entrepreneurial and so- cial responsibility go hand in hand. we want to make a key contribution to the sdgs with our businesses - guided by the principles of the u.n. global compact and in keeping with our vision \"health for all, hunger for none.\" this is 's approach and aspiration. and it is what we want to be judged on. we invest in research and development, and thus in tomor- row's innovative business models. that has always been the secret of 's success, and it is also the key to transitioning to a sustainable economy. sincerely, chairman of the board of management of ag chief sustainability officer sustainability report 2020 3 about this report about this report with this sustainability report, aims to provide trans- parent and in-depth insights into both its sustainability strat- egy and its sustainability performance. the report supple- ments the nonfinancial statement pursuant to the csr directive implementation act (csr-rug) that is published in the combined management report of the 2020 annual report. the reporting period is the 2020 fiscal year. the closing date for all data and facts was december 31, 2020. the group's sustainability reporting has been aligned to the guidelines of the global reporting initiative (gri) and the 10 principles of the u.n. global compact (ungc) since 2000. this report has been prepared in accordance with the gri standards: core option. this report also serves as a commu- nication on progress in line with the u.n. global compact. for the first time we also take into account the relevant re- quirements of the sustainability accounting standards board (sasb). a summarized index according to the three sasb industry standards relevant to us \"biotechnology & pharma- ceuticals,\" \"chemicals\" and \"agricultural products\" can be found on our website. in our climate reporting we follow the recommendations of the task force on climate-related financial disclosures (tcfd) and publish a separate index in pdf format also on our website. we also use, for example, the international recommendations and guidelines of the oecd and 26000 as a guide when defining and selecting nonfinancial indicators and in our reporting. in selecting and measuring our key data, we take into account the recommendations of the greenhouse gas protocol with respect to greenhouse gas emissions and those of the european federation of financial analysts societies, the world business council for sustainable devel- opment, the european chemical industry council (cefic) and the international council of chemical associations (icca) with respect to other nonfinancial indicators. data collection and reporting thresholds the selection of reported content is based on the results of our materiality analysis and the requirements of the gri standards. hr and hse (health, safety and environment) indicators and our social data are given for continuing operations unless otherwise explicitly indicated. reporting of the group's hse data includes all fully consoli- dated companies in which we hold at least a 50 percent interest. data on occupational injuries is collected at all sites worldwide. environmental indicators are measured at all environmentally relevant production, research and admin- istration sites. we consider all sites to be environmentally relevant whose annual energy consumption is greater than 1.5 terajoules. several indicators (particularly related to employees and procurement) are reported only for our significant locations of operation in line with the requirements of the correspond- ing gri disclosures. in 2020, this covered 17 countries that accounted for more than 80% of total group sales. where information is only relevant for parts of the group, we refer to this. in addition, deviations are indicated in the footnotes of the relevant tables and graphs. external verification the auditing

foundation activities our sustainability strategy significant ecological and social challenges and needs to attain our vision \"health for all, hunger for none.\" sustainability: a growth driver we reach millions of people worldwide with our products and services. we invest significantly in inclusive growth to facilitate a better life for more people - a life marked by good nutrition and health. to achieve this, we have set ourselves targets with regard to access to health care, food security, support for smallholder farmers and women's empowerment. at the same time, we are reducing our eco- logical footprint throughout our entire value chain - from our suppliers to our own production and the use of our products by consumers, patients and farmers. here we have set our- selves targets related to decarbonization, conserving biodi- versity and further reducing environmental impact. we hope that what is good for people and the environment will also be good for our company: we view sustainability as a growth driver for our business. in line with the global sustainable development goals (sdgs) of the united nations, we have established ambitious targets and want to be judged in the future on how effectively we attain them. our focus sdgs and our impact the challenges of the future are considerable: climate change, loss of biodiversity, extreme weather condi- tions and water crises are seen as global risks of our time. they are of special consequence for 's business of health and nutrition. yet they also harbor tremendous opportunities to help bring about a turna- round worldwide with our activities and our products, positively impact people's lives and achieve growth with sustainable businesses. society, politicians and investors are making an urgent ap- peal to take action that goes beyond mere risk minimization. they expect innovative, sustainable products and solutions to help people and the environment. they are voicing these demands with growing urgency and increasing vehemence. our customers too demand sustainable action from us and pass on to us consumer expectations as regards environ- mental protection, ethical conduct and social needs. we have a particular responsibility we know that the size of our business alone means we must and can make a significant contribution to sustainable devel- opment. we also know that our industries, especially the ag- riculture sector, are among the causes of the described challenges. at the same time, we believe our activities here have great potential for offering sustainable approaches. with innova- tive products and services, as well as the will to develop re- silient and future-oriented business models, we are going back to our roots: our purpose \"science for a better life\" guides our actions to help achieve a high quality of life on a healthy planet. to this end, we are driving forward science and innovation. we develop solutions that address the most sustainability report 2020 5

foundation activities enabling a better life for more people four billion people today have no access to basic health care, while three-quarters of a billion suffer from hunger. we want to help change

given support supporting smallholder farmers there are some 550 million small farmers worldwide. in many rural geographies in low- and middle-income countries (lmics), smallholder farmers are the backbone of food se- curity in their communities and thus play a crucial role in im- proving the quality of life; they feed more than half of the population in developing countries. a large segment of smallholders faces significant challenges including low productivity due to the lack of access to good quality crop inputs and inadequate knowledge of agricultural practices to improve productivity, along with affordable financing options and market access to sell their produce competitively. they are also exposed to impacts of climate change and post- harvest losses. all these challenges result in their inability to generate sustainable farm incomes impacting the livelihood of farm communities. our products, technologies and ser- vices already support around 45 million smallholder farmers in lmics. by 2030, we commit to help 100 million smallholder farmers to earn sustainable farm incomes and improve rural livelihoods. to achieve this goal, we shall further expand our product and service portfolio for smallholder farmers, includ- ing innovative business models and digital solutions across the entire crop system. to this end, we will establish crop value chain partnerships to deliver high-quality inputs, agronomy knowledge, cost-effective financing and risk miti- gation solutions and market linkages to sell their produce. these will include collaborations with, for example, govern- ment research institutes, ngos and international financial in- stitutions. additionally, does not intend to enforce its ip rights against smallholder farmers for private and non- commercial use of farm-saved seed to escape extreme pov- erty and will collaboratively work to integrate them into the world of commercial farming to improve their livelihood. target 2030: expand access to everyday health for 100 million people in underserved communities around the world access to everyday health care the covid-19 pandemic has shown the importance of ac- cess to health care. at least half the world's population is un- able to access basic medical services. this applies particu- larly to women and children in underserved communities. im- proved access to self-care products and services, in concert with targeted education, helps to prevent illnesses. in many regions, self-care is often the only option for ambitious health solutions. by 2030, we will have facilitated access to everyday health care for 100 million people in underserved regions or social strata. in 2020, we already reached 43 million people. target 2030: enabling 100 million women in lmics to gain access to modern contraception access to modern contraception gender equality will be a crucial factor in future economic and social development. modern contraception demonstra- bly helps to strengthen the role of women. it helps them de- termine their own path in life - often with positive effects on families and communities. nevertheless, more than 200 mil- lion women in low- and middle-income countries who want contraception still have no access to modern family plan- ning. as a leading global pharmaceutical producer of contra- ceptives, we have been active in this field for many years. in 2020, we reached nearly 40 million women in developing countries and emerging markets. we aim to enable 100 million women in lmics to gain access to modern contraception by 2030. with this goal in mind, we will expand our offering of long-acting products that are in especially high demand in international devel- opment projects, such as the jadelletm implant and the mirenatm coil. as is currently the case for oral contracep- tives and contraceptive injections, these products will be offered to our partners (such as the united nations popula- tion fund (unfpa)) at preferential conditions. further collaborations are planned; we pledge support irrespective of the products used. sustainability report 2020 6 sustainability strategy 1. the company 2. corporate governance 3.

along the upstream and downstream value chain by at least 12.3%, especially through procurement measures, but also by restricting business travel. co2 neutralization we will offset remaining emissions with a growing share of co2-neutralizing projects by acquiring certificates from au- dited climate protection projects that meet externally recog- nized quality standards. additionally, a huge opportunity presents itself through our plans to develop a certified busi- ness model for co2 capture for farmers. we have already begun this process in the united states and brazil. elements of the climate strategy climate resilience to facilitate a more sustainable supply chain, we help farm- ers better resist the effects of climate change - for example through improved agricultural practices. furthermore, we are following the recommendations of the task force on climate-related financial disclosures (tcfd) by including the climate aspects in our opportunity and risk management. additional ambitions of the crop science division we aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from our highest-emitting crops by 30% in our sales regions: the carbon initiative, which was launched in july 2020, rewards farmers in brazil and the united states for intelli- gent, climate-friendly processes such as forgoing me- chanical soil cultivation or using cover crops. we also aim to reduce the environmental impact of our crop protection products in important crops by 30% and expect this to have a positive impact on biodiversity. to achieve more sustainable production, we will implement the principles of the circular economy. additional ambition of the pharmaceuticals division in the future, we aim to increase the availability of our in- novative prescription products in lmics through pro- grams that promote fair prices and affordable products. we will already include our leading products xareltotm, eyleatm, mirenatm, adempastm and nexavartm in these projects this year. reducing the ecological footprint we help to protect the health of people, animals and plants, and to conserve ecosystems. our climate protection target corresponds to the objective of the paris agreement to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees celsius. it was confirmed by the science based targets initiative in summer 2020. we will also be a climate-neutral company by 2030. as a signa- tory to the business ambition for 1.5oc initiative, we want to attain net zero emissions in our entire value chain by 2050. our climate strategy comprises wide-ranging measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions within our company and along our entire value chain. co2 reduction by the end of 2029, we will reduce co2 emissions from our own business operations by 42% by increasing energy effi- ciency at our sites1 and sourcing 100% of our electricity from renewable energies. 1 scope 1 and scope 2 (market-based) emissions of the environmentally relevant sites, i.e. those whose annual energy consumption

deepen our cooperation with social organizations so as to understand other perspectives and jointly amplify the effects of our efforts. in 2020, we established a sustain- ability council composed of independent experts from around the world. this council combines knowledge and experience on the issues of biodiversity, digitalization, health systems, the food and agriculture industries, fair trade strat- egies, women's rights, sustainable technologies, sustainable finance and transformation strategies. the nine-member body advises the board of management of ag, oversees the implementation of the sustainability strategy and transparently reports on its work and gives recommendations, annually submitting a report on our progress. in 2020, the sustainability council met several times with board of management chairman , additional members of the board of management and representatives of the company to discuss topics such as biodiversity, product safety and access to health care. having personally worked for years on behalf of sustainabil- ity, all the members consider it important to help companies become more sustainable - especially if their impact poten- tial is as great as 's.

into the compensation system in 2020, we produced a timetable that shows how we aim to achieve our targets by 2030. qualitative sustainability tar- gets have been factored into the compensation systems for the board of management and management since 2020. beginning in 2021, quantitative targets will account for 20% of the long-term variable compensation of the board of management and entitled managerial employees. progress measurement system we have defined sustainability indicators to measure pro- gress in the attainment of our group targets. they help increase the transparency of our efforts and make it easier to steer them. our \"sustainability cockpit\" brings together key data in one place and facilitates decision-making by the management. the data is compiled in the countries and centrally validated. at the same time, the cockpit will enable accurate yearly reporting on the new sustainability indicators - because that is the commitment we have made.

the company 2. corporate governance 3. product stewardship 4. procurement 5. human rights 6. employees 7. climate protection 8. environmental protection and safety 9. foundation activities interview with systematically implementing sustainability what general deliberations marked the start of 's new sustainability strategy? when we began newly formulating our sustainability strategy in 2019, it quickly became clear that would align itself with the ambitious sustainable development goals (sdgs) of the united nations. a central role was played by the question of what part sustainability should play in our busi- ness strategy. we have defined sustainability as an impact generator; we don't regard sustainability as an accessory with which we adorn ourselves. it is an integral part of our business strategy. we can play a key role with our businesses in sustainably shaping the world, and we view sustainability as a growth driver. where can make a better contribution than other companies? four billion people today do not have access to basic health care, while three-quarters of a billion go to bed hungry every night. we want to change that. with globally leading busi- nesses in the fields of health and nutrition, we, more than nearly any other company, can help to improve people's health and safeguard nutrition for the growing world popula- tion - fully in keeping with our vision \"health for all, hunger for none.\" what role do investors play in the transformation? investors help companies to consistently integrate sustaina- bility into their business strategy by demanding quantifiable targets aligned to the sdgs and basing their investment decisions on these targets to the same degree as on finan- cial indicators. the major investors already demand that we do more for climate protection and sustainability. we are also seeing the invisible hand of the market becoming green through the eu's sustainable finance strategy. what successes can you report so far? in the summer of 2020, our climate protection targets were confirmed by the science based targets initiative. in the fall of 2020, we were one of just two german companies to re- ceive an a rating from the cdp in the areas of climate change and water security. this shows that our efforts are being acknowledged. we are doing our part to achieve the maximum objective of the paris agreement: limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees celsius. to record and steer our progress as regards the four central sustainability targets, we have established a differentiated measurement system. in the future, 20% of the long-term compensation of 's board of management members and upper management will depend on whether we succeeded in attaining these tar- gets. the quantification of the targets and their integration into our compensation system make us a pioneer in this area worldwide. these are initial successes - but we also know much more has to be done. what climate risks is especially confronted with? for us, these mainly exist in the impact climate change has on agricultural production. the most critical resource in that area is water, because it impacts yields. in dry conditions, there is less demand for crop protection products. other risks include extreme weather conditions such as heat, storms, flooding or fires, which lead to harvest losses, or locusts, which destroy harvests. yet these climate-related risks also harbor business opportunities for us because they create demand for new products that make crops more re- silient to many of these problems. last but not least, we are also exposed to operational risks such as the disruption of chemical production due to weather conditions. // , head of public affairs, science & sustainability can you give a specific example of how you are leveraging business opportunities? one good example is corn crops. with the help of gene edit- ing, has developed a variety with deeper roots that doesn't grow as high. these plants survived the hurricane in louisiana, for example, while other varieties simply became bent. we are currently revolutionizing corn breeding by simulating several seasons in giant greenhouses, enabling the utilization of large data volumes. in this way we make corn resilient to storms and drought while at the same time reducing fertilizer input. why should stakeholders believe a company like actually wants to drive the transformation? the measurability of our targets and their anchoring within our incentivization are evidence of that. further proof is offered by our external sustainability council, which will objectively assess the implementation of our sustainability strategy. what's more, we have intensified our transparency efforts. in 2020, spent around EUR5 billion to help achieve more sustainability through innovation. we need the trust of our stakeholders for all of this. only with their help can we master the transition process. sustainability report 2020 10

the world and employs 99,538 people. its head- quarters is in leverkusen, germany. sales at the group in 2020 amounted to EUR41.4 billion. 1.1 corporate profile as a life science company, we are a global leader in health care and nutrition. our innovative products support efforts to overcome the major challenges presented by a growing and aging global population. we help prevent, alleviate and treat diseases. we also aim to ensure the world has a relia- ble supply of high-quality food, feed and plant-based raw materials. as part of this endeavor, the responsible use of natural resources is always a top priority. in keeping with our vision of \"health for all, hunger for none,\" we want to con- tribute to putting an end to hunger, helping everyone lead a healthy life, and protecting ecosystems at the same time. this is what our purpose stands for, namely \"science for a better life.\" we aim to continuously enhance our company's earning power and create value for our customers, patients, share- holders, employees and society. growth and sustainability are integral parts of our strategy, guided by our corporate values of leadership, integrity, flexibility and efficiency

1.2 corporate structure corporate structure as of december 31, 2020 as the parent company of the group, ag - rep- resented by its board of management - performs the princi- pal management functions for the entire enterprise. this mainly comprises the group's strategic alignment, resource allocation, and the management of financial affairs and man- agerial staff, along with the management of the group-wide operational business of the crop science, pharmaceuticals and consumer health divisions. the enabling functions sup- port the operational business. they serve as group-wide competence centers and provide business support pro- cesses and services. structure of the group in 2020 board of management crop science pharmaceuticals consumer health enabling functions the following structural changes occurred within our organi- zation in 2020: the animal health business was sold to elanco animal health incorporated, greenfield, united states, and has therefore no longer been a part of the group since august 2020. pursuant to the resolution of the supervisory board of september 2019, the board of man- agement was reduced to five members at the beginning of 2020. responsibilities were adapted accordingly, with the role of labor director, for instance, being transferred to the chairman of the board of management. in january 2021, the supervisory board of ag an- nouncedf the appointment of sarena as a member of the board of management. effective february 1, she took up the new position of chief transformation and talent officer, as- suming responsibility for human resources, strategy and business consulting. as a result, the role of labor director was also transferred to as of this date. crop science crop science is the world's leading agricultural enterprise, with businesses in crop protection, seeds and digital farm- ing. we offer a broad portfolio of high-value seeds, im- proved plant traits, innovative chemical and biological crop protection products, digital solutions and extensive cus- tomer service for sustainable agriculture. we market these products primarily via wholesalers and retailers or directly to farmers. in addition, we market pest and weed control prod- ucts and services to professional users outside the agricul- ture industry. most of our crop protection products are man- ufactured at the division's own production sites. numerous decentralized formulation and filling sites enable the com- pany to quickly react to the needs of local markets. the breeding, propagation, production and/or processing of seeds, including seed dressing, takes place at locations close to our customers, either at our own facilities or under contract. pharmaceuticals pharmaceuticals concentrates on prescription products, es- pecially for cardiology and women's health care, and on specialty therapeutics focused on the areas of oncology, he- matology, ophthalmology and, in the medium term, cell and gene therapy. we have created an independent strategic unit for the area of cell and gene therapy that reports directly sustainability report 2020 12 sustainability strategy 1. the company 2. corporate governance 3.

division also comprises the radiology business, which markets diagnostic imaging equipment together with the necessary contrast agents. our portfolio includes a range of key products that are among the world's leading pharmaceuticals for their indications. the prescription products from pharmaceuticals are primar- ily distributed through wholesalers, pharmacies and hospi- tals. consumer health consumer health is a leading supplier of nonprescription (over-the-counter, otc) medicines, nutritional supplements, medicated skincare products and other self-care solutions in the categories of pain, cardiovascular risk prevention, der- matology, nutritional supplements, digestive health, allergy, and cough & cold. the products are generally sold by phar- macies and pharmacy chains, supermarket, online and other retailers and wholesalers. we report in more detail on the divisions' products, activities and sales and our sites worldwide in our 2020 annual re- port. we define value added as the company's total operating performance in the previous fiscal year (net sales + other operating income + financial income + net income/loss from investments accounted for using the equity method) less the costs of procured and consumed goods and services, de- preciation, amortization, impairment losses and impairment loss reversals. our total operating performance amounted to EUR43.7 billion in 2020. the cost of materials and other expenses totaled EUR36.2 billion. we recorded depreciation, amortization, im- pairment losses and impairment loss reversals of EUR13.3 bil- lion. due to the high special charges in relation to litigations and the impairments taken at crop science, we posted a negative value added of EUR5.8 billion in 2020. for more infor- mation, please see our 2020 annual report. despite the expected negative special items in 2020, we made a positive financial contribution to our stakeholders: employees EUR9.8 billion, taxes EUR1.5 billion, providers of equity and debt EUR1.5 billion and stockholders EUR2 billion ( ag dividend proposal for  value added by delivering innovative products and solutions, cre- ates value for its stakeholders at all stages of the value chain. we operate production sites worldwide, invest in re- search and development, work with international and local suppliers and contribute to the economic development of our target markets. as an employer, we provide jobs in in- dustrialized, emerging and developing economies and there- fore create purchasing power through the salaries we pay. we contribute to public finances and thus support public in- frastructure through the payment of taxes and other levies. 1.4 covid-19 our business was greatly affected by the covid-19 pan- demic in 2020. the health and safety of our employees and the provision of our products and medicines to patients, farmers and consumers has - as always - top priority. our business activities were affected in various ways by the protective measures taken worldwide and by the uncertainty associated with the pandemic. you can read more about this in the 2020 annual report. owing to the covid-19 pandemic, most of our conferences, workshops, training courses, audits and meetings in 2020 took place virtually. to make an important contribution to fighting the covid-19 pandemic, signed a collaboration and service agree- ment with the biopharmaceutical company curevac n.v., germany, at the beginning of 2021. within this collabora- tion, we will provide support to curevac for the further de- velopment and provision of the covid-19 vaccine candidate cvncov and for local activities in selected countries. we will contribute our expertise on the operational implementation of drug trials, regulatory tasks, pharmacovigilance activities, medical information and supply chain activities, and provide the corresponding infrastructure. we will also deploy our manufacturing network to contribute to vaccine production. we plan to supply 160 million doses of the vaccine in 2022. the first doses from our production could potentially be available by the end of 2021. to prevent the health crisis arising out of the pandemic also causing a hunger crisis for many farmers, we supported more than 1.5 million smallholder farmers in 15 countries in 2020 with seed and crop protection products. we help smallholders in regions threatened particularly by food short- ages with agricultural know-how and market access for agri- cultural produce, thus encouraging an increase in food pro- duction in these regions. our measures to

corporate governance. by adhering to laws, safeguarding values and strengthening our reputation, we aim to secure our company's long-term success and to foster a high level of trust among all stake- holders. our endeavors in this regard are further supported by our increased focus on sustainability aspects in all pro- cesses and at all levels of the company. 2.1 corporate governance practices and principles ag is subject to german stock corporation law and therefore has a dual governance system consisting of the board of management and the supervisory board. the board of management manages the company based on a transparent strategy that is geared toward its long-term suc- cess and complies with applicable laws and ethical stand- ards. the supervisory board oversees and monitors the board of management. corporate governance practices that go beyond the legal re- quirements are derived from our vision and our common val- ues, which form the basis for the respectful working relation- ship among our employees and with our external partners. compliance with responsible practices at every stage of the value chain is crucial in corporate governance. the main guidelines are summarized primarily in our corporate policies on compliance, human rights, and fairness and respect at work, as well as in our supplier code of conduct and the societal engagement (base) principles. the organiza- tion and oversight obligations of the board of management and the supervisory board are mainly ensured by compli- ance management and risk management systems. the base principles are grounded in our purpose \"science for a better life,\" our vision \"health for all, hunger for none\" and the life values of leadership, integrity, flexibility and efficiency. the principles describe our actions in eight areas: in our 2020 annual report, we report in detail on the main elements of the group's corporate governance struc- tures and conformity with the recommendations of the ger- man corporate governance code, relevant corporate gov- ernance practices, the composition and procedures of the board of management, the supervisory board and their committees, and the compensation report along with the objectives to be defined and the underlying concepts. 2.2 our ethical principles (base) as a leading health care and agriculture company, we bear a great responsibility. to ensure that we meet current societal expectations, we introduced the societal en- gagement (base) principles in 2019. set out in a publicly available corporate policy, these principles establish how we interact worldwide not just with our employees, but also with patients, customers, consumers, business partners, political stakeholders, scientists, critics and our stockholders. in this way, we want to live up to our social responsibility as a sus- tainably acting and transparent company that is respected for its contribution to progress in health care and agriculture. we want to listen, understand, take concerns seriously and engage in respectful dialogue - especially where this is diffi- cult or uncomfortable. // our engagement with society // our guiding principles and core values // how we drive innovation // how we act in the workplace // how we conduct our business // how we interact with our customers, patients and the consumers of our products // how we interact with media, legislators, regulators and civil society organizations // how we interact with shareholders 2.3 transparency as our products and activities concern the sensitive areas of health and nutrition, they lead to inquiries and the desire to understand what we do. against this background, we en- deavor to build and strengthen trust - for which transparent conduct is essential. for example, we disclose information from various areas of our work and openly communicate how the safety of our products is assessed. gri 102-43 sustainability report 2020 14 sustainability strategy 1. the company 2.

management systems we supply information about our transparency efforts in the following areas, for instance: // we make detailed disclosures on, for example, material and project expenses and headcount of the national liai- son offices in the transparency registers of the european institutions and the u.s. congress, for instance. we also report data for countries in which there is no legal disclo- sure obligation. for more information, please see chapter 2.5 compliance and our website. // through the transparency at crop science website, we grant public access to safety-relevant studies that regula- tory authorities use to approve crop protection product registrations. // we publish information on planned and ongoing clinical patient trials on our clinical trials website. // in relations between the pharmaceutical industry and phy- sicians, other healing professions and health care organi- zations, ensures compliance with the efpia (euro- pean federation of pharmaceutical industries and associ- ations) disclosure code. // in a bid to generate more transparency around our scien- tific collaborations and thus increase trust in science, we are launching the science collaboration explorer in the spring of 2021. in this publicly accessible database, we will publicly disclose new contract-based collabora- tions with universities, public institutions and affiliated in- dividuals. the pilot phase will begin in germany before gradually being rolled out in other countries around the world. for more information on our transparency initiative, please see our website. we transparently shape our corporate governance in ac- cordance with the german corporate governance code. for more information, please see our 2020 annual report. 2.4 steering and management systems planning and steering the board of management uses defined, primarily nonfinan- cial targets and key performance indicators to steer the company's sustainable orientation. in 2019, the board of management adopted an advanced sustainability strategy along with new nonfinancial group targets and key perfor- mance indicators (see also the sustainability strategy sec- tion). in 2020, the corresponding framework was translated into specific targets for the individual divisions. nonfinancial group targets are now integrated into the group's planning and steering process as management and key per- formance indicators. our group-wide sustainability targets are integrated into the compensation system for the board of management. in so doing, we aim to continuously increase value for stockhold- ers and other stakeholders and ensure the continuity of our company for the long term. for 2020, qualitative nonfinan- cial targets derived from the sustainability strategy were in- corporated into the short-term variable compensation of the board of management. from 2021, quantitative targets de- rived from the sustainability strategy will be integrated into the long-term variable compensation of the board of man- agement with a weighting of 20%. for more information on board of management compensa- tion in 2020, please see the compensation report (chapter 4.4) in the 2020 annual report. details of the financial indi- cators we employ to plan, steer and monitor the develop- ment of our business are given in chapter 1.2.3 manage- ment systems of the 2020 annual report. integrated management system maintains an integrated management system (ims) comprising process management, management of internal regulations, effectiveness testing and continuous improve- ment. all of the requirements are specified in a corporate policy. the ims provides a framework for all management systems at , ensuring compliance with the law and with internal and external requirements while also ensuring efficient ways of working. this is achieved through internal regulations and applicable processes involving clear roles and responsibilities. as such, it facilitates effective risk man- agement and helps to safeguard the company's license to operate. within the ims, each organizational unit - such as quality; health, safety & environment; risk management and public affairs, science & sustainability - is responsible for ensuring that its own management system is in line with business needs and with applicable legal and regulatory require- ments. as part of the ims, has established a clearly defined set of rules, which includes fundamental principles and framework conditions, standards of conduct, guidelines and methods. moreover, these are binding requirements that in- clude legal and regulatory requirements. our binding internal regulations at group level serve as key management instruments and are classified in three catego- ries: corporate policies (highest importance covering global interdisciplinary content, and relevant for all employees), corporate directives and procedures. sustainability report 2020 15 sustainability strategy 1.

compliance corporate regulations policies directives procedures binding regulation categories 2.5 compliance manages its businesses responsibly and in compli- ance with the statutory requirements and regulations of the countries in which it operates. we define compliance as le- gally and ethically impeccable conduct by all employees in their daily work, because the way they each carry out their duties affects our company's reputation. we do not tolerate any violation of laws, codes of conduct or internal regula- tions. compliance is essential for our long-term commercial success. compliance management the board of management is unreservedly committed to compliance, and will forgo any business transaction that would violate any of the 10 principles in our corporate compliance policy observed throughout the group. these principles are as follows: // we compete fairly in every market. // we act with integrity in all our business dealings. // we balance economic growth with ecological and social responsibility. // we observe trade controls that regulate our global busi- ness. // we safeguard equal opportunity in securities trading. // we keep accurate books and records. // we treat each other with fairness and respect. // we protect and respect intellectual property rights. // we act in 's best interest. // we protect and secure personal data. all employees are required to observe the compliance princi- ples and to immediately report any violation of the corporate compliance policy. infringements are sanctioned. this ap- plies in particular to managerial employees, who, for exam- ple, may lose their entitlement to variable compensation components and be subject to further disciplinary measures if violations have occurred in their sphere of responsibility. compliant and lawful conduct is also factored into the per- formance evaluations of all managerial employees. the global compliance management system is steered by a central compliance organization within the group. this organization is headed by the group compliance of- ficer, who, in this capacity, reports directly to the chief fi- nancial officer (cfo) and to the audit committee of the su- pervisory board. the cfo is responsible for the compliance organization, while the audit committee of the supervisory board oversees the effectiveness and further development of compliance within the group. within the compliance or- ganization, specialized compliance managers are responsi- ble for establishing business-, industry- and country-specific standards. potential compliance risks (such as corruption) are identified together with the operational units to ensure the systematic and preventive detection and assessment of risks. potential risks are then entered into global databases that we use to develop suitable measures for specific processes, business activities or countries, for example. in addition, we assess our business partners according to risk criteria as we look to identify potential compliance risks. adherence to the corporate compliance principles is among the subjects covered in audits conducted by 's internal audit and in the analyses and investigations by the legal and compliance organization. the heads of these organizations provide regular reports on the findings of the audits and analyses to the audit committee of the supervisory board, while summary reports are presented at least once a year. the planning of these audits by internal audit follows a func- tion- and risk-based approach that also takes the corrup- tion perceptions index of transparency international into ac- count. function-specific audits are conducted worldwide across all important corporate units, such as for marketing and distribution. the larger businesses and units are audited at shorter intervals, and the smaller units at longer intervals. a total of 90 audit reports were compiled in 2020, of which 11 concerned preventive compliance system audits or inci- dent-related investigations. the reduction in the number of audit reports compared with 2019 (125 audit reports) was primarily due to travel restrictions caused by the covd-19 pandemic. in addition, not all audits can be carried out re- motely as an alternative. handling of suspected and actual compliance violations suspected compliance violations can be reported - anony- mously if desired and if permitted by respective national law - to a central, worldwide compliance hotline that is also ac- cessible to the general public. in 2020, the compliance sustainability report 2020 16 sustainability strategy 1. the company 2. corporate governance 3. product stewardship 4. procurement 5. human rights 6. employees 7. climate protection 8. environmental protection and safety 9. foundation activities 2.5 compliance organization received a total of 345 reports in this way (in- cluding 226 anonymous reports), with 18 reports coming from germany and 327 from other countries. alternatively, suspected violations may also be reported to the respective compliance functions or to internal audit. compliance violations include all possible types of infringe- ments of internal and external requirements and are system- atically sanctioned. the action taken depends on factors in- cluding the gravity of the violation and applicable law. all cases are recorded according to uniform criteria throughout the group and dealt with under the rules set forth in 's management of compliance incidents corporate policy. where an investigation confirms that a compliance vi- olation has occurred, the company has a graduated set of measures at its disposal. these include a verbal warning or written reprimand, transfer to a different unit, cancellation of a planned promotion, a reduction in the short-term incentive payment, downgrading to a lower collectively agreed pay rate or managerial contract level, and ordinary or extraordi- nary termination. also reserves the right to assert fur- ther claims against the employee for cost reimbursement or damages and/or to initiate criminal proceedings. compliance training and communications activities we support all employees in acting with integrity and proac- tively avoiding potential violations by implementing - wide training measures and communication campaigns that are tailored to target groups and based on identified needs. the corporate compliance policy forms the basis of our compliance communication and training activities. both su- pervisors and compliance managers are available to answer employees' questions about lawful and ethical behavior. in 2020, around 94% (38,132) of 's managerial em- ployees worldwide completed at least one compliance train- ing program. furthermore, we launched a new web-based training program in 89 countries covering the giving and ac- cepting of gifts as well as interactions with public officials and health care professionals, with these topics also ad- dressed in our corporate compliance policy. the video training program is available in 10 languages (english, ger- man, spanish, portuguese, dutch, french, italian, russian, japanese and chinese) and had been completed by around 65% (81,550) of our employees as of december 31, 2020. in 2020, we introduced a company-wide \"speak up\" com- munication campaign with the goal of fostering an open cul- ture for reporting compliance violations. data privacy data is very important in today's world - it is often accessi- ble worldwide and its financial value is growing. as a result, people have an increasing interest in their data remaining secure. is committed to protecting the personal data of all its stakeholders, be they employees, business part- ners, stockholders, suppliers or customers. fulfilling this commitment is an important business principle and a central condition for the company's success. since there is no globally binding data privacy law, legisla- tion varies widely from country to country. to establish a standard for all countries in which operates, a group- wide approach is required. this is the only way to ensure personal data is afforded sufficient protection while at the same time facilitating efficient business processes. the data privacy corporate policy sets out minimum require- ments for the way personal data is processed throughout the group. strives to protect people's privacy and prevent their data from being misused. we are aware of the potential harm caused by unlawful data processing and have therefore established a standard to minimize this risk. the data privacy management system addresses risk situa- tions that are relevant to the company's business. the sys- tem covers the entire data life cycle: from collection, trans- fer, analysis and storage to deletion. the core elements of the data privacy management system - the maintenance of a processing registry, the management of data leaks, inquir- ies from affected individuals and risk mitigation - are man- datory. training and guidance along with system-based monitoring ensure the regulations are adhered to. marketing compliance and the validity of recognized standards we do not tolerate any improper exertion of influence on our business partners. as part of our compliance management system, we record and investigate any suspected violation of our responsible marketing principles, irrespective of whether the complaints come from internal or external sources. the most important corporate regulation in this con- text is our anti-corruption corporate policy, which is supple- mented by the rules of conduct for responsible marketing. furthermore, we are committed to ethical advertising and communication for all our products and services. directives and corporate regulations are also in place at to prevent price fixing and ensure data protection. where several regulations are applicable, we fundamentally comply with the more stringent standards. the respective corporate regulations and training programs are imple- mented in the divisions and enabling functions. sustainability report 2020 17 sustainability strategy 1. the company 2. corporate governance 3.

products and medical de- vices that have been adopted by major national and interna- tional associations and organizations also apply to market- ing and distribution at . in many countries, these standards are further underpinned by local codes - all of which apply to prescription pharmaceuticals and some of which also apply to nonprescription medicines, dietary sup- plements, medical devices and medicated skincare prod- ucts. all codes of the international federation of pharmaceutical manufacturers & associations (ifpma) serve as a binding minimum global standard for all of 's human pharma- ceutical products in their area of application. in addition, observes the codes of the european federation of pharmaceutical industries and associations (efpia) in its in- teraction with health care professionals and patient organi- zations. regarding the advertising of human pharmaceutical products, complies with the regulations set out in the ifpma code of practice as the minimum global standard along with those set forth in regional and national codes. the aforementioned codes contain provisions governing, among other matters, advertising materials, the distribution of samples, cooperation with members of specialist groups in connection with speaker and consultancy contracts, and scientific studies. pharmaceuticals observes the applicable transparency rules (e.g. the physician payments sunshine act in the united states) and participates in voluntary pro- grams such as the efpia disclosure code. in line with the principles of sustainable development and the responsible use of crop protection products and seeds, crop science follows the guidelines of its product steward- ship commitment, principles and key requirements. this policy, which also satisfies our rules of conduct for responsi- ble marketing, is based on the international code of con- duct on pesticide management issued by the food and ag- riculture organization (fao) of the united nations and the international code of conduct on plant biotechnology is- sued by croplife international. and politicians are part of the political culture. direct and in- direct donations by companies to political candidates and parties are prohibited at the federal level. against this back- ground, employees of numerous companies support individ- ual candidates for parliamentary office by making private do- nations through political action committees, or pacs. these voluntary donations are made only by employees, not the company. pacs are separate, segregated funds governed by employees and further regulated by the u.s. federal election commission and some state governments. relevant training measures on product-related communica- tion, antitrust law, data protection and anti-corruption are fun- damental elements of our compliance management system. principles communicated in these training courses provide an overview of globally applicable minimum requirements for co- operation with key stakeholders, including in particular those in the health care industry such as physicians, hospitals or patient organizations. in addition to explaining general compli- ance principles, the anti-corruption courses provide specific advice on approaches to nonreciprocal benefits and the ex- change of services with health care professionals. lobbying 's commitment to ensuring transparent lobbying forms part of our base principles. in line with this, our code of conduct for responsible lobbying sets out binding rules for our involvement in political matters, covers compliance-rele- vant risks and creates transparency in our interactions with the representatives of political institutions. as set out in this corporate regulation, as a company does not make any donations to political parties, politicians or candidates for political office. an exception to this rule exists in the united states, where donations to candidates decisions on how these contributions are allocated are made by an independent committee composed of employ- ees. at , the name of the corresponding committee at , new allocation criteria were introduced in 2020 to reflect societal challenges, among other factors. for exam- ple, candidates' positions on issues such as climate change and the protection of biodiversity play an important role here. also undertakes to support candidates from both parties. these donations are subject to stringent condi- tions and mandatory transparency measures. the contributions are regularly reported to the u.s. federal elec- tion commission (fec). full details can be viewed on the fec website. does not support presidential candi- dates. a total of us$458,550 was donated to political candi- dates at all levels through in 2020. in view of its activities at numerous sites in the united states, has decided to make corporate donations at the state level. these amounted to a total of us$499,850 at the state level in 2020. in other countries, industry associations of which we are a member (such as the german chemical industry associa- tion) sometimes make donations on their own responsibility in observance of the respective statutory regulations, and particularly laws concerning political parties. sustainability report 2020 18 sustainability strategy 1. the company 2. corporate governance 3. product

be- tween the company and political stakeholders. we publish details of material costs, project expenses, employee num- bers and any of the other statistics required in each country, for example in the transparency registers of the european in- stitutions and the u.s. congress. in doing so, we go beyond the statutory requirements. for instance, we also publish data for countries such as germany where there is no legal disclosure requirement. in 2020, the costs incurred at the li- aison offices totaled approximately EUR2 million in berlin, ger- many; EUR2.4 million in brussels, belgium; EUR8.5 million in wash- ington, d.c., united states; EUR0.3 million in moscow, russia; EUR1 million in brasilia, brazil; and EUR1.6 million in beijing, china. 2.6 tax 's tax concept, which we refer to as our approach to tax, sets out our management approach and tax strategy and is based on the following guidelines: // we place great importance on transparency and verifiable compliance and reporting standards. // our tax considerations are driven by business needs. // the taxation of our earnings takes into account global value chains. for global companies like , it is in their own vital inter- est that they pay adequate taxes in countries in which they operate, as this is the only way to ensure public funding is available for necessary investments in education, infrastruc- ture and social standards, as well as for promoting innova- tion. 's approach to tax, which can be viewed on our web- site, summarizes the main aspects and principles of our in- ternal tax policy. updates to the tax policy are reviewed and approved by the head of group finance and the group cfo. observes the applicable regulations and the associ- ated disclosure obligations. these efforts may include the involvement of external experts or consultation with the re- spective tax authorities, for example. these principles addi- tionally apply whenever service providers are commissioned. as the continuous further development of tax legislation is also in our interests, we participate in the political discourse while observing the stipulations of the code of conduct and our base principles (see chapter 2.2 our ethical principles (base)). ethical conduct is of paramount importance, and employees are encouraged to voice any concerns they might have, address problems and put our values into prac- tice. suspected compliance violations can be reported via the central compliance hotline (see chapter 2.5 compli- ance). tax risks are accounted for in the group's global risk management system (see also chapter 2.7 risk manage- ment), which is overseen by the board of management of ag. as an element of financial reporting, it is also subject to regular review by the external auditor. in this con- nection and in observation of the legal requirements, separates corporate auditing from tax consulting so as to rule out conflicts of interest in advance. 2.7 risk management as a global life science enterprise, we are exposed to a wide range of internal and external developments and events that could significantly impact the achievement of our financial and nonfinancial objectives. opportunity and risk manage- ment is therefore an integral part of corporate management at . we have implemented a holistic and integrated risk manage- ment system designed to ensure the continued existence and future target attainment of the group through the early identification, assessment and treatment of risks. our risk management system is aligned to internationally recognized standards and principles such as the 31000 standard of the international organization for standardization. the board of management of ag holds overall re- sponsibility for an effective risk management system. the audit committee of the supervisory board examines the ap- propriateness and effectiveness of the risk management system at least once a year and reports thereafter to the full supervisory board. the assurance committee, which is chaired by the cfo, is a committee of the board of management. as well as ensuring that appropriate action is taken to control any substantial risks, the assurance committee regularly discusses and reviews the risk portfolio and the status of the risk control measures. sustainability report 2020 19 sustainability strategy 1. the company 2. corporate governance 3. product stewardship 4. procurement 5. human rights 6.

of risks lies with the operational business units in the divisions and enabling functions. risks are identified by risk owners in those areas. where possible, the identified risks are evaluated with regard to their potential impact and likelihood of occurrence while taking into account estab- lished risk control measures. to support the fullest possible identification of risks, we maintain a risk universe that re- flects the company's potential risk categories. the risk universe, which is regularly updated, expressly ac- counts for risks of a nonfinancial nature that are linked to our business activity or to our business relationships, prod- ucts and services. risks pursuant to the csr directive im- plementation act that relate to environmental, employee and social issues, human rights, corruption and bribery (compli- ance) are included as well. detailed information on the basic elements of the risk man- agement system, including the risk management process, and details on our risk status are provided in the 2020 an- nual report in the opportunity and risk report. material legal risks are described in the 2020 annual report under note b [30] legal risks. 2.8 sustainability management sustainability is an integral element of our corporate strat- egy. our sustainability strategy represents our enhanced fo- cus on increasing the overall societal impact of our business activities. the chairman of the board of management as- sumes responsibility for this strategy in his role as chief sustainability officer. he is supported in this role by the public affairs, science & sustainability enabling function. this function identifies areas of activity and develops strate- gies, targets, key performance indicators, management sys- tems and corporate regulations and is responsible for com- piling the sustainability report. operational implementation takes place in the divisions and along the value chain. each of our divisions has an estab- lished sustainability organization, with sustainability aspects also being integrated into the processes of the enabling functions. the attainment of sustainability targets will also be inte- grated as an additional parameter into the long-term variable compensation (lti) of eligible managerial employees from 2021, similar to the compensation of the board of manage- ment. our commitment to the u.n. global compact and the re- sponsible care(tm) initiative of the chemical industry and our involvement in the world business council for sustainable development (wbcsd) underline our mission as a company that acts sustainably. sustainability council a major element of our intensified sustainability efforts in 2020 was the establishment of an independent sustainability council. this comprises nine internationally recognized ex- perts from the areas of health care, nutrition, agriculture and the environment, representing a broad range of views, differ- ing geographical origin and different genders. the sustaina- bility council advises the board of management in the fur- ther development of its business strategy as regards sus- tainability and with respect to what contribution research and development can make to sustainability. the contribu- tions of the sustainability council inform our strategic plan- ning going forward. it will also independently examine the progress made by in the implementation of its sus- tainability targets. the council additionally examines the support of social innovations through the foundations. another goal for the nine experts is to promote cooperation with networks in society, education, industry and politics. the sustainability council convenes twice a year for deliber- ations and reports annually on the progress of its work. the chairman and other members of the board of management also attend these meetings. the body's work kicked off with two virtual meetings in 2020. materiality analysis we determine the expectations and requirements of the vari- ous stakeholders using a materiality analysis that surveys global representatives of important stakeholder groups, managerial staff and nonmanagerial employees. the results thereof reveal relevant issues, the latest developments, along with sustainability-related opportunities and risks, and help us to assess them accordingly. the survey of external stakeholders also reflects how our sustainability perfor- mance is perceived, which enables us to identify weak- nesses and areas for improvement. at the next stage, managers supplement the assess- ment of issues of relevance from an external perspective with an estimation of the impact the company has on the environment, employees and health in each respective topic area. finally, the issues prioritized on this basis are ap- proved by the board of management. gri 102-43, 102-44, 102-46 sustainability report 2020 20 sustainability strategy 1. the company 2. corporate governance 3. product stewardship 4.

life. on- going dialogue with our stakeholders is therefore particularly important to us. after all, their expectations and viewpoints affect our public acceptance and thus our commercial suc- cess. this is also reflected in our base principles (see also chapter 2.2 our ethical principles [base]). we fundamentally distinguish four stakeholder groups with which we engage in discussions on different issues. this dialogue helps us to recognize important trends and developments in society and our markets at an early stage and take this information into account when shaping our business. the integration of various stakeholder groups is planned within the scope of our stakeholder engagement process. this process also includes an evaluation of the re- sults of individual dialogue measures. in strategic decision-making processes such as investment projects and product launches, approaches key social and political players right from the start of a new project to canvass their support. such open dialogue enables us to identify opportunities and risks early on. this process is in line with our stakeholder engagement guideline and is sup- plemented by an internal information platform. gri 102-40, 102-42, 102-43, 102-44, 102-46, 102-47 sustainability report 2020 21 sustainability strategy 1. the company 2. corporate governance 3. product stewardship 4. procurement 5. human

our most important stake- holder groups. throughout the last year, we held intensive discussions with journalists and politicians, scientists and supervisory authori- ties, consumers and shareholders, civil society organiza- tions, farmers and neighbors. we not only discussed topics such as agriculture and nutrition, climate change and biodi- versity, but also combating poverty and family planning. ex- amples include our virtual event series future of farming di- alogue 2020, the world food convention about food secu- rity, the sustainable investor summit, which included the topic of sustainable agriculture, the euractiv conference on transparency in eu policymaking, including in relation to glyphosate, the 18th international dialogue on population and sustainable development on ensuring the right to sex- ual and reproductive self-determination during the covid- 19 pandemic and the 2020 concordia summit, which in- cluded a session on fixing our food & nutrition systems. included dialogues on food security at the munich security conference and on innovation at the annual meeting of the world economic forum, as well as stakeholder dialogues on sustainability during the u.n. general assembly. the increasing interest of the capital market in sustainability topics was reflected in our talks with investors and rating agencies in 2020. these conversations revolved around questions related to our sustainability strategy focusing mainly on climate protection, our group targets and the role they play in management compensation, the tasks of the sustainability council, and the effects of our products on the environment - especially as regards crop protection prod- ucts and genetically modified plants. other important topics were the integration of monsanto and especially the group's response to the covid-19 pandemic. we prioritize being a reliable partner that is aware of its soci- etal responsibility toward the communities adjacent to our sites. to this end - at our production sites in particular - we maintain open dialogue between local management and community members, which is supported by the respective country organization. this dialogue involves personal discus- sions with residents, citizens' initiatives, representatives of religious communities and the regional press. this commu- nity dialogue is anchored in a globally valid corporate policy on site management. in different ways for each division. with regard to the collec- tion of customer satisfaction data, different legal require- ments apply to prescription medicines from pharmaceuticals than to nonprescription medicines, for example. the primary market research and data research that must be conducted, including systematic internet analysis, strictly adheres to the legal requirements, which can vary significantly depending on the market. at crop science, customer centricity is achieved by way of the several hundred initiatives of the food chain partnership throughout the value chain and through bayg.a.p. this ca- pacity building program is implemented with food chain partners in many of these initiatives, and through for- wardfarming, a global collaboration with farmers. these programs center on innovative crop solutions and services for sustainable agriculture. we also address the most signifi- cant challenges facing humankind. in this regard, we forge alliances with ngos, value chain partners and the public sector, and jointly develop new solutions - for example to prevent the spread of pathogens such as tr4 (tropical race 4) on banana plants or to control plagues of locusts. for more information on dialogue with stakeholders, please see the chapters 2.8 sustainability management, 3 product stewardship (commitment), 4 procurement (developing suppliers), 5 human rights (commitment) and 6 employees (dialogue and exchange) and our sustainability website. various live discussions on socially relevant issues were held in the social network kedin -

safety 9. foundation activities focus on: agriculture challenges and approaches global agriculture and food systems are confronted with major challenges, such as climate change, water scarcity and population growth. scientists and u.n. organizations expect the world population to grow to around 10 billion by 2050 - an increase of around two billion relative to 2020. in addition, both the food and agriculture organization (fao) of the united nations and the world resources institute (wri) envisage a 50% increase in the demand for food, ani- mal feed and biofuels by 2050. the demand for animal- based protein and thus also for animal feed is expected to increase further, especially in the emerging markets. at the same time, the already limited farmland will decline due to climate change, water problems, soil erosion and other fac- tors. the agricultural sector therefore has to meet the needs of a growing population while at the same time promoting sustainability and protecting our ecosystems. sustainable intensification intensive agriculture with high yields per hectare of farmland is a crucial factor for ensuring the continued availability of high-quality and affordable food. that's because agricultural intensification will lead to less and less land being required for food production. while agricultural yields have grown by 60% over the past 40 years, the amount of agricultural land has increased by only 5%. this productivity increase was made possible by technological developments in the areas of plant breeding and - since the 1990s - plant biotechnol- ogy, fertilization, irrigation and crop protection. insecticides future  each plot = approx. 10 bushel/ 250 kg corn yield 1940 and fungicides have played a part in minimizing harvest losses. crops compete with weeds for water, nutrients and light; herbicides help to reduce this competition. helps farmers cultivate more food for a growing popu- lation while at the same time reducing the environmental im- pact of agriculture. digital technologies play an important role here, as do improved seed and good agricultural prac- tices. to reduce harvest losses caused by insect pests, competitors for nutrients or fungal infestation, we combine our high-performance seeds with the targeted use of crop protection products. we can therefore offer farmers a selec- tion of these innovations and recommend optimal combina- tions that enable the use of agricultural production factors at sustainability report 2020 23 sustainability strategy 1. the company 2. corporate governance 3. product

re- sponsible use of crop protection products and the applica- tion of digital farming technologies, please see chapter 3.6 product stewardship - crop science. in selective plant breeding, existing species of a crop (e.g. corn) are crossed to transfer the desired qualities to the next generation of plants. our innovations in the areas of plant breeding and crop pro- tection are designed to further improve both the quality and the quantity of harvests and enhance plants' resilience against insect pests, diseases and a changing climate. for more information on our innovations, please see chapter 1.3 of the 2020 annual report. intensified farming certainly has also led to a local decline in species and in some ecosystem services - in other words, the beneficial effects people derive from ecological systems - due, for example, to the removal of structural landscape elements, the narrowing of crop rotation systems or certain agricultural practices such as excessive use of crop protec- tion products or fertilizers. we invest in research and devel- opment so as to attain an improved balance between productivity and conserving biodiversity and ecosystem ser- vices. for more information on our activities to conserve bio- diversity, including pollinator insects, please see chapters 3.6 crop science and 3.7 biodiversity. plant breeding plant breeding (including of hybrid cultures) plays a key role in achieving high agricultural yields. supports the re- sponsible use of different cultivation techniques. our scientists combine large volumes of genomic, pheno- typic and environmental data for selective breeding in plants to develop some of the most high-performance seed prod- ucts in the world. we use test series to determine whether the desired traits have been transferred to the following gen- erations. our greenhouse- and field-based product testing and our scalable data analysis and automation functions give us additional insight into the unique characteristics of our prod- ucts, such as plants' ability to thrive during water scarcity. this enables us to give our customers tailored recommenda- tions that take into account factors such as the climatic cir- cumstances of a region. targeted breeding: genome editing crop science employs new breeding methods that contrib- ute to the development of modern varieties better suited to their environments, making it possible to farm more sustain- ably. one targeted breeding approach is a molecular biology pro- cess known as genome editing, which is largely based on improving plants' characteristics by leveraging their existing genetics; for example, deactivating unfavorable qualities (such as disease vulnerability) or supporting beneficial quali- ties (such as drought tolerance or improved nutrition). the use of modern breeding methods including crispr-cas can improve the efficiency and precision of plant cultivation and contribute to the development of the new crop varieties needed to sustainably secure the supply of safe, affordable and healthy food. short stature corn one example of the possibilities offered by new breeding techniques is our short stature corn, which we intend to commercialize in the coming years: through breeding, plant biotechnology and genome editing, we have suc- ceeded in developing seed varieties that enable the growth of shorter corn plants that have the potential to not bend or break as easily as corn plants of regular height in the presence of strong winds or heavy rain. losses in the united states due to bent plants amount to between 5 and 25% a year depending on the severity of weather events. short stature corn also has the potential to enable a more optimized uptake of water and nutrients such as nitrogen through the less pronounced develop- ment of the other plant parts. sustainability report 2020 24 sustainability strategy 1. the company 2. corporate governance 3. product stewardship 4. procurement 5. human rights 6. employees 7. climate protection 8. environmental protection and safety 9. foundation activities plant biotechnology plant breeders use the genetic biodiversity of plants to gen- erate new and unique plant varieties and hybrids for famers. plant biotechnology (genetic modification) can then be em- ployed to transfer genes and their associated beneficial traits from one organism to another. genetically modified crops provide substantial agronomic, economic and ecologi- cal benefits: they can help farmers to increase productivity despite difficult growing conditions by protecting harvests from pests and weeds while consuming fewer natural re- sources. farmers in large and small enterprises from indus- trialized and developing countries alike can benefit from ge- netically modified crops, especially corn, soybeans, cotton and oilseed rape/canola. according to information from the nonprofit organization (international service for the acquisition of agri-biotech applications), crops that are the product of modern biotechnology are grown on more than 190 million hectares in over 29 countries. specializes in high-quality seeds with groundbreaking traits that offer not just higher yields, but also improved weed control and more effective defense against insects. our genetically modified plants containing bacillus thurin- giensis () control specific insect pests attempting to di- rectly feed on the plant. other insects such as bees and ad- ditional pollinators are not harmed by plants. the deploy- ment of these plants can considerably reduce the use of broad-spectrum insecticides. our herbicide-tolerant plants are tolerant to certain herbi- cides such as glyphosate or dicamba. this enables weeds in fields to be eliminated using herbicides without damaging the crops. using these plants enables farmers to reduce or completely forgo tillage as a method of weed control and in- stead use techniques such as plowless soil tillage, which is applied in particular in north and south america. in combi- nation with good practice such as the cultivation of cover crops, plowless soil tillage has a positive impact on soil health. it reduces erosion, facilitates the development of hu- mus and thereby ensures increased storage of carbon in the soil. this in turn reduces the release of greenhouse gases from the soil that can contribute to climate change. further- more, farmers need less fuel for tillage when there is no plowing requirement. the development and approval of genetically modified seeds are subject to comprehensive international guidelines and stringent national laws and regulations. the safety of genet- ically modified crops has been confirmed by numerous stud- ies, which have been evaluated by regulatory authorities in 70 countries. there are fears in society that genetically mod- ified plants could spread throughout the environment and thus negatively impact plant biodiversity. however, cross- pollination between a genetically modified plant and a wild one would require the plants to be very closely related. vari- ous studies demonstrate that the introduction of genetically modified crops has not negatively affected crop biodiversity. preserving plants' integrity breeding for conventional and ecological farming requires measures to preserve the plants' integrity and thus main- tain seed quality. this means that the uncontrolled polli- nation or cross-breeding of plants must be prevented. pollen flight plays a key role here, including as regards genetically modified seed. for example, in our breeding of corn, an open pollinated crop, it is essential to be aware of and to limit the possible spread of the pollen under dif- ferent conditions. detailed agricultural practice require- ments are in place for our own sites and those of our seed producers to prevent inadvertent pollination. these rules are spelled out in our publicly accessible technology use guide for corn, soybeans, oilseed rape/canola and other row crops. among other information, it contains provisions for planting at a prescribed distance to other fields of the same crop type or planting at different times to prevent simultaneous pollination in two fields. there is no evidence that local or native plants are re- duced in the unlikely event of inadvertent cross-pollination between genetically modified and nongenetically modified plants from the same species. there is also no evidence that seed diversity has decreased because of the intro- duction of genetically modified crops. after reviewing more than 900 studies, the u.s. academies of science published a report in 2016 stating that it did not see any indication that the genetic diversity of major seed varieties in countries such as the united states had declined due to the introduction of genetically modified seeds. the number of available seed varieties had instead declined already during the 20th century due to strong demand for high-yielding seeds. sustainability report 2020 25 sustainability strategy 1. the company 2. corporate governance 3. product stewardship 4. procurement 5. human rights 6. employees 7. climate protection 8. environmental protection and safety 9. foundation activities 3.1 management approach product stewardship assuming responsibility for our products, from medicines to complex solutions for agriculture, is always at the core of what we do. they should be of the highest quality and con- tribute to a better life. this means that neither their develop- ment and manufacture nor their disposal should cause dam- age to people and the environment. for this reason, we strictly conform to regulations and laws all over the world. 3.1 management approach for us, product stewardship means that our products satisfy the highest quality standards and are safe for people, ani- mals and the environment when properly used. not only do the desired properties of substances and products need to be taken into consideration but also the possible risks for people and the environment. we respect legal requirements, and our voluntary commitment and internal standards go beyond these in a variety of areas. has put in place suitable directives and management systems to implement regulatory and voluntary product stewardship requirements. these are steered by our corporate health, safety & envi- ronment enabling function and the quality functions of the divisions. 3.2 regulatory conditions 's finished products, such as pharmaceuticals, crop protection products, seeds and biocides, are subject to very stringent regulations prescribing specific and detailed ap- proval and authorization procedures. as a result, our products cannot be sold on the market until they have been approved by a competent authority or an of- ficial registration has been granted. the prescribed efficacy and safety of the individual products must always be demonstrated as proven as a condition of their approval. an approval therefore only applies for a particular product with the formulation registered in the marketing authorization. changes in the product composition (such as new formula- tions for crop protection products) require an additional au- thorization or registration. wherever there is no dedicated crop protection legislation in a given country, has made a voluntary commitment to distribute there only those crop protection products whose active ingredients are approved or registered in at least one oecd country to ensure that their safety has been ade- quately verified. for more information, please see chapter 3.6 crop science. in addition to the regulation of finished products, extensive statutory regulations also apply to the chemical substances handled by during product manufacture. chemical substances are subject to the respective regional chemical regulations. these include reach in the european union, the lautenberg chemical safety act (formerly tsca) in the united states and the measures for environmental manage- ment of new chemical substances (order no. 7) of the min- istry of environmental protection (mep) in china. to fulfill these requirements, we have approved group-wide and divi- sion-specific policies. authorities, in the european union for example, review the implementation of obligations resulting from chemicals legis- lation through regular inspections. to meet these obliga- tions, we require our suppliers to acknowledge conformity with reach for all substances they supply to us. the classi- fication and labeling of chemicals enables users to become informed about the risks associated with chemicals. implements the globally harmonized system (ghs) for the classification and labeling of chemicals worldwide. besides the regular registration obligation, reach can also entail an additional authorization procedure that can lead to the replacement of, or a ban on the use of, particularly ous substances. already registered substances are also regularly evaluated by the authorities. for substances this can result in additional testing requirements, new risk management measures or inclusion in the reach authoriza- tion procedure. to date, only one substance has been affected, for which authorization has already been granted. the requirements of mep order no. 7 in china are similar to those of reach in the eu, although mep no. 7 in china provides for greater grandfathering of products that are al- ready on the market. in the united states, all substances must be approved in accordance with the lautenberg chemical safety act and accompanied by information required pursuant to the stand- ard hazard communication (29 cfr 1910.1200) of the u.s. occupational safety and health administration.

protection and safety 9. foundation activities 3.3 assessments and testing voluntary assessment of substances handled we voluntarily apply comparable standards around the world, independent of the respective national legislation. for all handled substances with an annual volume of more than one metric ton that are not subject to the reach regulation, we have (voluntarily) undertaken to successively provide comparable minimum data sets on ecotoxicology and toxicology. this data enables the potential of all substances (> 99%) we use in quanti- ties exceeding one metric ton per year to be assessed. by the end of 2020, we had already assessed 95.18% (2019: 93.4%) of these substances. 3.3 assessments and testing our substances and finished products undergo extensive assessment and testing to ensure product efficacy and safety. we examine possible health and environmental risks along the entire value chain and use this to derive appropri- ate measures to mitigate risks. the safety of our products is the top priority. as early as the research and development stage, we assess the properties of our active ingredients and all other substances that are contained in a product and could thus impact the properties of a finished product (e.g. additives that support the actual active ingredients). we discontinue the development of ac- tive ingredients with undesirable properties in application of the precautionary principle as defined in principle 15 of the rio declaration of the united nations and communication com (2000) 1 of the european commission. there should not be a unilateral focus on hazard potential, but rather a balanced benefit-risk evaluation. all active ingredients emerging from research are subjected to further extensive testing and assessments at the develop- ment stage that include (legally prescribed) animal studies. for more information, please see chapter 3.4 animal wel- fare. we also conduct environmental risk assessments or implement risk management measures for our active ingredi- ents subsequent to their registration. moreover, we help to raise questions about the impact of active ingredients in the environment and to have them addressed through sound risk assessments and analyses. we carry out the risk assessments for our substances ac- cording to recognized scientific methods such as those de- scribed in the guidance on information requirements and chemical safety assessment of the european chemicals agency (echa). should the analysis reveal that the use of a certain substance is not safe, we take steps to mitigate risk. these can vary from revised application recommendations to substitution of a substance. in this case, a replacement that is economically and technically viable needs to be sought. the substitution of chemicals is basically a continu- ous task for the chemical and pharmaceutical industry in its endeavors to generate new or substantially improved prod- ucts and processes. this is integral to our commitment to responsible care(tm). the applicable assessment steps are established in a corporate regulation. strict international and national laws and regulations also control the official approval and therefore development of crop varieties and plant traits and the recognition and com- mercialization of seeds and planting material. this also en- compasses genetically modified seeds. we meet all regula- tory requirements of the countries in which we distribute our crops. extensive and intensive safety reviews of the environ- mental and health risks for people and animals are con- ducted at all stages of the product development process from early development onward. the results of these are in- corporated into the approval/authorization procedures. our corporate regulations on the responsible use of genetic engineering and biosafety together with processes stipu- lated at crop science in the product stewardship commit- ment, principles and key requirements corporate regula- tion, supplement the legal and regulatory requirements. processes are established throughout the company to ad- dress inquiries about product safety or problems with prod- ucts of ours that are already available on the market. this feedback is also integrated into our risk assessment. more information about the products of the pharmaceuticals and consumer health divisions can be found under (see chapter 3.8 pharmaceuticals and con- sumer health) and about the (crop protection) products of the crop science division in chapter 3.6 crop science. information on substances and products compiles safety data sheets for all chemical substances used, regardless of whether or not this is required by law. safety data sheets are the central tools of communication for safety-relevant information about substances and mixtures in the supply chain. targeting professional users, they contain in- formation on a substance's properties and on using it safely. in addition, technical information is provided for professional use. appropriate packaging information is provided for all end consumer products, an example being package inserts for pharmaceuticals. in accordance with the respective product safety and infor- mation obligations, we compile product information for raw materials, intermediates and end products, and make this information available across the company worldwide. sustainability report 2020 27 sustainability strategy 1. the company 2. corporate governance 3. product stewardship 4. procurement 5. human rights 6. employees 7. climate protection

initiatives. since 1994, has supported the responsible care(tm) initiative of the chemical industry and the associated re- sponsible care(tm) global charter. we actively participate in the further development of scientific risk assessment and are involved in several associations - such as the european (cefic), u.s. (acc) and international (icca) chemical indus- try associations and the oecd - and in initiatives such as the european centre for ecotoxicology and toxicology of chemicals (ecetoc). 3.4 animal welfare animal studies are legally required and essential from a sci- entific viewpoint for assessing the safety and efficacy of our products. we aim to minimize the use of study animals and to employ alternative methods whenever possible. responsibility for animal welfare at lies with the global animal welfare committee. we respect all legal re- quirements pertaining to animal welfare, compliance with which is verified both by regulatory authorities and by means of internal audits. in addition, applies its own princi- ples on animal welfare and animal studies, which are speci- fied in a corporate regulation we published in 2020. the global animal welfare committee monitors compliance with these principles within the group and in external stud- ies. our principles also apply to the research institutes we commission and to our suppliers, whose compliance with our animal welfare requirements we regularly monitor. commitment to reducing animal studies in early drug screening, continuously establishes differ- ent computer-based and in-vitro processes that help reduce the number of animal studies or the impact on animals in sub- sequent testing. included in this are our activities in connec- tion with organ-on-a-chip, a biochip method used to simulate organs in a cell culture. we also actively participate in interna- tionally renowned consortia, projects and validation programs geared toward achieving replacement methods, one example being the imi-etransafe project: the focus is on examining the extent to which control animals can be replaced in toxico- logical studies through the simulation of \"virtual control groups\" using existing data sets. this could reduce the num- ber of animal studies by up to 25% in the medium term. in addition, a recent breakthrough in the field of three-dimen- sional bioprinting may have a positive impact on the amount of animal studies conducted. scientists at tel aviv university managed to print a miniature heart using human tissue. in co- operation with , research is now being conducted to es- tablish the degree to which organs produced with this tech- nology could be used in various medical tests in the future, thus potentially further reducing the need for animal studies. applying performance indicators, we analyze the develop- ment of animal numbers, the distribution according to spe- cies and the impact on our test animals each year, while evaluating studies and discussing possible steps in ance with the 3rs principle (replace, reduce, refine). the to- tal number of study animals used in 2020

capseal technology to include sol- ids and seeds packaging. we support association initiatives and work closely with crop protection and law enforcement authorities to prevent the introduction of counterfeit products to the market by criminal networks. our activities in the area of crop protec- tion products are currently focused particularly on coopera- tion with the chinese customs authorities to identify coun- terfeit products when attempts are being made to export them from china and to stop this. in 2020, we identified pa- tent and trademark infringements in china, india and brazil, and successfully asserted our legal rights. counterfeit products, and especially counterfeit crop pro- duction products, are transported on a large scale by ocean freight. that's why has been cooperating for a num- ber of years now on a cross-industry basis with leading shipping companies to jointly identify counterfeit and illegal products, prevent their transport and notify the responsible authorities for further prosecution. we conduct our own inspections in the market worldwide and keep a record of all signs of suspicious and potentially counterfeit or illegal products. product counterfeiting can only be addressed internationally through a joint approach by industry, associations, govern- mental agencies and nongovernmental organizations. we advocate the resolute application and, where necessary, the tightening and expansion of existing laws and provisions that serve to enable the identification and confiscation of ille- gal products. we support these efforts through extensive measures of our own in the areas of production and pack- aging development that are designed to also enable our customers to distinguish original products from counterfeits. crop science the production, sale and distribution of counterfeit crop pro- tection products take place within globally organized crimi- nal networks, and the negative effects are amplified by nu- merous opaque internet offers. the use of counterfeit crop protection products poses an increased risk for human health and the environment because their  do not correspond with the products formulated by and ap- proved by the regulatory authorities or do not contain ap- proved active ingredients. counterfeit seeds often do not possess the traits chosen by farmers upon purchase. illegal seeds treated with unknown chemicals can also present a risk for people and the environment. innovative packaging technology: capseal it is becoming increasingly difficult for those who use crop protection products to distinguish between an original and a counterfeit product. is thus the first producer of crop protection products to enable farmers to clearly identify original products through capseal technology. the closure seal has optical security features and a qr code that users can scan with an interactive smartphone app to receive important information about the product's authenticity. capseal is found on the packaging of all crop protection products that are filled in bottles on the counterfeits in agriculture website, we provide our customers with information on how to identify counterfeit and illegal crop protection products or seeds and what risks they harbor. the site also gives farmers tips on how to pro- tect themselves against counterfeiting. pharmaceuticals and consumer health counterfeit products that imitate the medicines of our phar- maceuticals and consumer health divisions harbor consid- erable risks for patients and consumers. for this reason, has established binding policies in its uniform group- wide quality management system for reporting, registering, investigating and escalating potential pharmaceutical coun- terfeiting. together with the responsible pharmaceutical reg- ulatory authorities, we initiate the necessary measures based on investigation results and the serious nature of each case. these measures range from notifying business partners and medical specialist groups to recalling products impacted by counterfeiting at the appropriate recall level. through the beware of counterfeits campaign, is ac- tively addressing the problem of counterfeit pharmaceuticals together with public authorities in germany and abroad. the website of the same name contains information on the risks of counterfeit pharmaceuticals and offers tips on how pa- tients can protect themselves against counterfeiting. in co- ordination with the regulatory authorities, the website also provides information on actual pharmaceutical counterfeiting incidents and explains how patients can distinguish the counterfeit items from our original products. in addition to the process established in the quality man- agement system, we are currently implementing a data management tool for the corporate security and legal func- tions. it contains assessments and reports on activities by law enforcement authorities in connection with pharmaceu- tical counterfeiting that were triggered by information and analyses we submitted. sustainability report 2020 29 sustainability strategy 1. the company 2. corporate governance 3. product stewardship 4. procurement 5.

requirements and measures for the verification of original pharmaceuticals. this includes mandatory security features on external packaging, which has used for its prescription products since 2019. these data matrix codes are stored in country-specific databases across the eu. wholesalers and pharmacies can verify the products' au- thenticity by simply scanning the code. security features of this kind are also used in additional countries, such as china. in other countries, such as the united states, these security features are already implemented for pharmaceuti- cal manufacturers and are being successively expanded to include additional market participants in the distribution chain. supports and actively supports these measures with the goal of ensuring standardized protection of patients against pharmaceutical counterfeiting in as many countries as possible. for years now, we have also voluntarily em- ployed tamper-evident closures for our prescription medi- cines and many of our nonprescription products as well to prevent packaging manipulation. to make the supply chain for pharmaceutical products safer, participates in the binational security for phar- maceuticals

counterfeiting. has assumed the leadership role in this project regarding its practical use in the supply chain. we are also actively working to define and structure the anti- counterfeiting use case to facilitate the identification of origi- nal pharmaceuticals by all market participants, including pa- tients, across platforms and technologies. we are also ac- tively involved in the pharmaceutical security institute, an in which pharmaceutical companies provide mutual support in detecting product-counterfeiting-related crimes. 3.6 crop science before crop protection products and technologies can be in- troduced to the market, it must be demonstrated that they are harmless to people and can be used without exposing the environment to an unjustifiable risk. they therefore re- quire official approval, which is governed by numerous inter- national and national laws and regulations. we test products in compliance with the applicable official regulations and perform extensive risk assessments. we also observe the import regulations for the importing countries and acquire product approvals in countries in which the products are due to be marketed. crop science works continuously to improve its products and develop solutions for sustainable agricultural practices. the focus of these efforts is on optimizing product benefits for our customers and applying the findings from product monitoring. for us, product stewardship begins at the re- search and development stage of a new product, continues through its production, marketing and safe use and ends with disposal, for example of product packaging. we have specified our principles of responsible product management in our product stewardship commitment, prin- ciples and key requirements corporate regulation. it is based on established and internationally recognized stand- ards such as the international code of conduct on pesticide management issued by the food and agriculture organiza- tion of the united nations (fao) and the world health or- ganization (who), the guidelines of the crop protection as- sociation croplife international, and the guidelines of the in- dustry initiative excellence through stewardship (ets) for seeds and traits. this initiative promotes, for example, the introduction of product stewardship programs and quality management systems for seeds throughout the life cycle and entrusts independent outside experts with the perfor- mance of audits to verify that member companies are com- plying with its guidelines. our plant biotechnology sites in mexico,

well as information on plant breeding. furthermore, through the openlabs program initiated in 2020, we offer the public the opportunity to observe our scientists during a two-day event as they carry out a safety registration study. here, the participants learn how we collect data on the safety of our crop protection prod- ucts by complying with guidelines such as good labora- tory practice (glp). as it currently is not possible to visit our monheim site due to the covid-19 pandemic, we are examining options for replacing these tours with a virtual visitor platform. research and development we use the latest knowledge and technologies to develop products and services so that we can continuously optimize their efficacy, productivity and safety for people and the en- vironment. as part of the testing process, chemical and biological crop protection products are examined early in the development phase with regard to their mode of action, their (eco)toxico- logical properties and the extent of potential residues in plants and the environment to ensure that only those products with the best safety profile are developed further. to determine risks more precisely, we perform extensive safety testing as defined by law. the development of genetically modified seeds is also sub- ject to extensive international guidelines and stringent na- tional laws and regulations. we have specified internal pro- cesses in a corporate regulation to ensure a responsible ap- proach to biotechnologically manufactured products throughout their life cycle. for more information on plant breeding and genetically modified seed, please see the chapter focus on: agriculture. production, packaging, storage and transport health, safety, environmental protection and quality are a top priority for at all its sites around the world, includ- ing at the crop science sites where crop protection or seed products are produced. a health, safety and environment (hse) management system with uniform standards applies group-wide. product manufacture at crop science is per- formed according to the quality management standard 9001. for more information, please see chapter 8 environ- mental protection and safety. as with our suppliers, we ex- pect our third-party producers to conduct their business with in accordance with the requirements of our sup- plier code of conduct. for more information, please see chapter 4 procurement. we ensure that our products are adequately packaged and are stored and transported ac- cording to the applicable legal and regulatory requirements. for more information, please see chapter 8.9 transportation and storage safety. marketing, sale and distribution in its distribution of crop protection products and technolo- gies, crop science observes the international code of con- duct on pesticide management of the food and agriculture organization (fao) of the united nations. our principles are established in our product stewardship commitment, princi- ples and key requirements corporate regulation. in addi- tion, since 2012, we have no longer sold who class 1a or 1b agricultural crop protection products despite continued formal authorization to do so. we did not apply for and receive marketing authorization in the european union for all our crop protection products even if the active ingredients or finished products are manu- factured in the eu. the export of these crop protection products means they are used in plants that are not exten- sively cultivated in the eu and therefore not demanded by farmers. it is also possible that the area of application (such as fungal or pest infestation) does not apply in the eu be- cause the relevant climatic conditions are rare or nonexist- ent. the conditions for farmers - for example, as regards cli- matic conditions, cultivated crops, prevailing plant diseases and pests, and approved and available crop protection products - vary from one country to the next. this is also re- flected in the requirements of the respective regulatory au- thorities. we regularly review the products we offer in emerging mar- kets and developing countries with respect to the applicable specifications for ensuring the safety of our products and re- ducing the risks associated with their use. we voluntarily withdraw such products from the market if identified risks cannot be sufficiently limited.

we market only those crop pro- tection products whose active ingredients are registered in at least one oecd country, or, in the case of new active in- gredients, for which an oecd data package has been com- piled. internal processes were established to comply with this voluntary commitment. in the future, we aim to set even higher standards. we are therefore reviewing new proce- dures to introduce crop protection products in emerging markets only if they satisfy both the local safety standards in the respective country and the requirements of leading rele- vant regulatory authorities. for the marketing of genetically modified seeds, we have es- tablished internal processes and defined the requirements for the responsible use of biotechnology in our product stewardship commitment, principles and key requirements corporate regulation. we provide our customers with comprehensive, transparent and reliable information about our products and services in accordance with our corporate responsible marketing & sales policy. users of our products can contact us through a range of communication channels should they have com- plaints or inquiries or wish to report any incidents. these in- clude both direct contact with our sales staff as well as hot- lines as printed on our product packaging. we register ex- ternal incidents or complaints involving our crop protection and seed products and process them with the aid of a dedi- cated management system. if necessary, we undertake measures ranging from labeling changes to product recalls in line with our key requirements. counterfeit products harbor substantial risks for users and the environment. for more information on our strategy for preventing product piracy, please see chapter 3.5 protec- tion against product counterfeiting. integrated crop management for pest and resistance management crop science supports the implementation of integrated crop management measures that combine various strate- gies for controlling weeds, pests and plant diseases in farming. this overall concept is tailored to the special chal- lenges facing farmers, and it enables them to unlock their full economic potential while at the same time minimizing the environmental impact of their farming activities. we offer a broad portfolio of innovative chemical and biological crop protection solutions, high-value seeds and data-driven ap- plication solutions and recommendations that help farmers protect their crops safely and responsibly in accordance with the particular requirements of the fields, crops and soils. forwardfarming initiative crop science promotes and supports ecological en- hancement measures in agriculture and the recovery and protection of natural and semi-natural habitats. together with farmers and scientific experts, we are working to find solutions to preserve biodiversity e.g. through the forwardfarming initiative. forwardfarming pro- motes the implementation of sustainable agriculture in practice across a global network of independent agricul- tural operations. on forwardfarms, we show how sustainable agri- culture involving integrated crop management and re- sistance management can be put into practice. in these representative operations, farmers demonstrate modern cultivation techniques, approaches to applying seeds and crop protection products, and the action they take to handle resources responsibly. the forwardfarms pro- mote dialogue with users and enable the worldwide ex- change of ideas and findings among various stakeholder groups. there are currently 24 crop science forward- farms spread across europe (20), latin america (3) and asia (1). responsible use of crop protection products through targeted training courses, we show farmers, seed treatment professionals and distributors how to use our products both effectively and safely to maintain healthy plants and increase the yield and quality of their harvested goods. our objective is to continuously increase the out- reach of our training activities, in part through more wide- spread use of digital media in the future. the training courses convey  such as safe handling of our products during transport, storage and disposal, the correct use of protective clothing, and first aid measures in the event of emergencies. the training topics can be adapted for a certain target group, a crop plant being used in cultiva- tion or a particular product according to local requirements. our training materials are available in various formats - from on-site presentations to brochures, videos, posters, manuals and live chats. in addition to special training measures for farmers and those who use crop protection products, we also combine training activities with events such as product launches or field days to reach a large number of farmers and distributors. our training videos on the safe handling of crop protection products are also available online. gri 102-43

protection and safety 9. foundation activities 3.6 crop science in 2020, crop science replaced numerous on-site personal training activities with virtual measures due to the covid-19 pandemic. it was thus able to increase the number of farm- ers trained to around 1.7 million farmers worldwide. we fo- cused our training activities on countries where there are no statutory certification requirements for farmers concerning the handling of crop protection products. for this reason, training participation was highest in asia, followed by african countries and latin america. our partnerships allow us to increase the reach of the activities and conduct joint events, for example with universities, information centers or local, regional and international associations. as part of 's safe use ambassador initiative launched in 2017, we enter into partnerships with universities and of- fer students annual training in the safe use of crop protec- tion products, with a focus on safety for users and the envi- ronment. the goal is for the students to share their new knowledge with farmers during internships on farms. in 2020, organized workshops on the safe handling of crop protection products for the students and faculty mem- bers of 51 universities in 12 countries, especially in asia. crop science additionally trains farmers in various technical areas regarding the correct use of individual products. this in- cludes training as mandated by the u.s. environmental pro- tection agency (epa) as a condition of registration for prod- ucts containing the herbicide dicamba for use in dicamba-tol- erant soybean and cotton crops. this training course was de- veloped in cooperation with other dicamba herbicide regis- trants and governmental certification authorities. successful completion of the training enables farmers to purchase and apply any dicamba products registered for use in dicamba-tolerant soybean and cotton crops. more than 57,000 users in the united states completed this certi- fication in 2020, 50% of whom were trained by . product stewardship for glyphosate the nonselective herbicide glyphosate is used in many countries for effective, simple and cost-effective weed control. the active ingredient was first introduced in 1974 and has since been marketed under a number of different tradenames in hundreds of crop protection products by several dozen different companies worldwide. in europe, glyphosate-based herbicides are most frequently used according to the label to control weeds in various field crops. according to the label, applications include weed control in gardens and noncultivated areas, such as in in- dustrial complexes and along railway tracks. glyphosate works in plants by specifically inhibiting an enzyme that is essential to plant growth. this enzyme is not found in cells of humans or animals. combining glyphosate with crops that could withstand applications of this herbicide transformed agriculture. farmers who cultivate glyphosate-tolerant crops tend to adopt conservation tillage, which brings its own benefits in terms of reduced soil erosion, improved water quality and lower carbon dioxide (co2) emissions. in agricultural systems where glyphosate-tolerant crops are not availa- ble, glyphosate provides benefits for farmers and the en- vironment by simplifying weed management and reducing the need for mechanical tillage and enabling the adoption of cover crops. outside of agriculture, glyphosate delivers benefits for noxious or invasive weed control. glyphosate degrades in the environment and does not accumulate in the food chain. it is not volatile and will bind to soil after application rather than run off into waterways. food safety authority (efsa) and the german federal in- stitute for risk assessment (bfr) and other leading regu- latory authorities such as the u.s. environmental protec- tion agency (epa) and the canadian governmental au- thority for pest control belonging to the department of health (health canada pest management regulatory agency [pmra]). the most extensive agricultural epidemi- ological study ever with detailed information on glypho- sate use, the agricultural health study published in the journal of the national cancer institute in 2018, also found no association between the use of glyphosate- based herbicides and the occurrence of non-hodgkin lymphoma. the study followed more than 50,000 licensed applicators of crop protection products for more than 20 years. glyphosate's favorable environmental safety profile under- lies its ability to be used in many diverse settings. de- tailed reviews by the efsa, pmra and other regulatory authorities have concluded that approved uses of glypho- sate-based herbicides are unlikely to cause adverse ef- fects on the environment. in the united states, epa sci- entists reached the same conclusion following their pri- mary environmental review and have initiated a final step in the reregistration process to ensure current uses ac- count for potential effects on endangered species. this is a standard review for all pesticides in the united states and can take several years to complete. sci- entists are reviewing the draft report on endangered spe- cies and look forward to engaging as part of the public comment period. glyphosate has a proven track record of more than 40 years of safe use when used according to label direc- tions. this is confirmed by science-based evaluations conducted by regulatory bodies such as the european extensive information on the public discussion surround- ing the safety of glyphosate for users and the environ- ment is available on our website. for information on the lawsuits against in the united states, please see

protection and safety 9. foundation activities 3.6 crop science use of digital technologies for , digital farming is an important tool for creating a better balance between productivity and environmental con- servation. the goal of digital farming is to use resources such as water, fertilizer and crop protection products more efficiently and sustainably. sensors on the latest tractors and harvesters can supply im- portant information on soil conditions and plant health. this and further data is incorporated into the digital applications developed by the digital farming business of crop science - the climate corporation - to help farmers achieve more effi- cient and sustainable agricultural operations. our digital farming platform climate fieldview(tm) enables farmers to improve their yields through data support. this takes place through the sensor-based collection and stor- age of large volumes of machine-generated agronomic data directly at the farmers' accounts. the application of this data not only helps farmers, but also creates substantial ad- vantages for the environment. thanks to precision agricul- tural machinery and digital tools, inputs such as seeds, , fertilizer and crop protection products are only used when and where they are necessary. climate is currently available in north america, south america, turkey, south africa and europe. the application of these new technologies enables a reduc- tion of the resources needed for plant production and also promotes the safe and responsible use of crop protection products. for example, the use of satellite and drone data al- ready allows slight differences in the field to be accounted for and crop protection products to be individually and precisely applied in the required amount (zone and spot spraying). in 2020, crop science continued its strategic partnership with chinese drone producer xag for the use of this tech- nology, including for the targeted treatment of field crops. we have established two guidelines for the safe use of drones: one for the conduct of internal trial demonstrations and one for commercial application, meaning the application of crop protection products in customers' fields using drones. in various countries, we carry out corresponding training courses for our employees and those of our re- search partners. for example, in 2020 we joined with local partners to train more than 200 employees and over 1,000 external users in china in the safe use of drones. the notes to the consolidated financial statements in 's 2020 annual report. it is of central importance for crop science to offer farm- ers a broad range of solutions to improve the sustainabil- ity and productivity of their operations. glyphosate will continue to play an important role in agri- culture and in our product range. as one-size-fits-all solu- tions do not account for nature's needs, however, we plan to invest around EUR5 billion in the current decade to re- search additional weed control methods and thus provide farmers with more options in the future. furthermore, as a member of the european glyphosate renewal group (grg), we also take measures to ensure more transparency. for example, we make information such as the complete application for renewal of registra- tion in the eu, the minutes of meetings with regulatory authorities and the summarizing dossier from 2012 availa- ble online. we plan to offer the public insight by opening up our laboratories as soon as it is possible to do so safely in view of the covid-19 pandemic. in 2020, the grg undertook significant, transparent steps to renew the substance's registration: at the beginning of june, it submitted the new scientific glyphosate dossier to the as- sessment group on glyphosate (agg), which is com- posed of the regulatory authorities of france, hungary, the netherlands and sweden, acting jointly as rappor- teurs for the four eu member states. we made the dos- sier, which the agg checked for completeness and was therefore formally permissible, available to the public for the first time on glyphosate.eu. the agg has begun the scientific review and evaluation. sustainability report 2020

foundation activities 3.6 crop science water protection the avoidance of crop protection product discharges into water bodies is an important aspect of sustainable agricul- ture. alongside point source discharges into water bodies that can occur during the filling and cleaning of spraying de- vices, diffuse substance discharges from treated acreages can also play a significant role. that is why many of our training measures for farmers also focus on protecting bod- ies of water through the correct use of our products. to avoid point source discharges, crop science recom- mends the use of biological remediation systems such as phytobac(tm). this is designed to prevent water contamina- tion with residues of crop protection chemicals generated during the filling and cleaning of spraying devices or the dis- posal of residual liquids. the system is already used in many eu countries and offered commercially by various third-party manufacturers. more than 5,000 phytobac(tm) systems are currently in operation in europe. pilot facilities have also been implemented in australia, canada, china, thailand, ar- gentina, brazil and colombia. in collaboration with external partners, crop protection is also developing a digital geoinformation system (gis) for ag- riculture in order to protect neighboring water bodies from contamination risks caused by diffuse substance dis- charges. site-related contamination risks are visualized by means of high-resolution maps supplemented with risk miti- gation proposals. with this initiative we are offering our agri- cultural customers a digital decision-making aid that facili- tates both compliance with high environmental standards and optimal flexibility in productivity-oriented issues. scale- up of the digital system is possible up to the country level, with the following countries already mapped: germany, the netherlands and belgium. to more effectively meet increasing demands for environ- mental protection and occupational safety, crop science has developed the closed transfer system called easyflow together with agrotop gmbh. this closed, contamination- preventing discharge system for liquid crop protection prod- ucts enables full or partial discharge and is fully self-clean- ing. the system is used in practice for the small-scale spray- ing of fruit and vegetables. protecting pollinators and other beneficial insects bees and other pollinators are hugely important for sustaina- ble food production, and we also depend on healthy pollina- tors in our seed business. shares the concerns about currently declining insect populations and has published a position on this issue. as the causes of this decline have not yet been fully clarified, we believe further scientific studies of the causes and the development of corresponding counter- measures are urgently needed. we are therefore involved in researching the factors leading to a decline and developing measures to counter this trend. our research supports farmers in food production while at the same time contributing to the health, safety and biodi- versity of pollinators. we promote dialogue with all stake- holder groups through our global network. in cooperation projects worldwide, we are looking into some of the major stress factors for pollinators and into new approaches for protecting them and the pollination of crops. at the same time, we are engaged in the development and implementa- tion of approaches to protect insect biodiversity in the agri- cultural landscape where the current state of knowledge al- lows for the definition of effective measures. to minimize potential risks posed to pollinators by our crop protection products, initial tests particularly to measure bee toxicity are already carried out at an early development stage to ensure that only products with an environmental profile that allows a pollinator-safe use are further devel- oped. crop protection products are stringently regulated and undergo thorough testing to make sure they can be used safely. we perform extensive safety testing and risk as- sessments, enabling us to recommend specific bee safety measures to farmers. metastudies on plants featuring technology (genetically modified plants that contain genes of the soil bacterium ba- cillus thuringiensis () - see focus on: agriculture) have not identified any biologically relevant effects on honeybees. the neonicotinoids chemical class represented a major evolution for agriculture when it was first commercialized in the 1990s. in contrast with many insecticides available at that time, they exhibited markedly lower toxicity for hu- mans. replaced other less user-friendly in- secticides in numerous areas, thus limiting their use. sys- temic insecticides such as imidacloprid can be applied on fields in the form of seed treatments, in other words as a protective layer around the seed grain. seed treatment is essential in many crops because plant growth can be in- hibited and crop yields reduced if the delicate seedlings are attacked by insect pests. when plants are protected at an early stage through seed treatment, less crop pro- tection product has to be sprayed later on - which mini- mizes the potential risks for pollinators and other benefi- cial insects. however, if used as spray application during blooming, certain neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and sustainability report 2020 35 sustainability strategy 1. the company 2. corporate governance 3. product stewardship 4. procurement 5. human rights 6. employees 7. climate protection 8. environmental protection and safety 9. foundation activities 3.6 crop science clothianidin) can be very harmful to pollinators. labels were amended accordingly and flowering application was excluded. in 2008, the improper seed treatment with the neonicotinoid clothianidin was identified as the cause of local bee deaths. in 2018, marketing authorization for the neonicotinoids imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and clothi- anidin was withdrawn in the european union for field ap- plication. application of neonicotinoids by farmers has since been possible to a limited extent in individual eu countries and certain crops through emergency approv- als. emergency approvals are temporary authorizations that are only granted in exceptional situations and under specific conditions. they enable the limited and controlled use of a crop protection product for a certain crop over a period of no more than 120 days in one year. please see our website for more information on emergency approvals. it is important to us to ensure in the use of neonicotinoids that a minimal burden is placed on bees while at the same giving farmers the protection they need for their crops. in recent years, therefore, we have revised the scope of application of crop protection products we pro- duce based on neonicotinoid active ingredients. we have withdrawn from the market some formulations for areas of application that could be dangerous to bees. for some applications, such as seed treatment or the spray appli- cation of nonblossoming field crops (e.g. sugar beet), ne- onicotinoids continue to have a positive benefit-risk pro- file. here we have developed formulations of the active in- gredients that enable the products to be used in ance with the respective regulations. study results on ne- onicotinoids are publicly accessible on our website. it is of central importance to weigh up the benefits and risks of neonicotinoids as well as to take a holistic view of this topic, as the alternatives may also cause adverse ef- fects and harbor risks. in our research and development we are working on corresponding environmental risk pro- files, details of which will be published over the course of 2021. against this background, products have a balanced risk profile for both people and the environment. since patent protection for neonicotinoids expired, our market share has declined substantially overall. signifi- cant parts of our business with clothianidin and clothi- anidin-containing products were sold in 2018. the busi- ness retained by , in particular cereals, oilseed rape/canola and beet crops, generates far fewer sales than the part of the business divested. the remaining uses of neonicotinoids in the portfolio have under- gone extensive risk assessments and represent the best option for farmers with respect to agronomic benefits and environmental and operator safety. in sivantotm, we have developed and commercialized an insecticide that can replace various applications of neon- icotinoids. in many cases, however, sivantotm competes with much cheaper products marketed by producers of generic neonicotinoids. butterfly populations of the migratory monarch butterfly, which are common in north america, have declined in recent decades due to intensive farming and the associated reduction in food sources, the loss of breeding grounds, weather and cli- mate changes, natural enemies, disease pathogens and par- asites, and the loss and deterioration of wintering grounds. to better understand and be able to protect the living condi- tions of monarch butterflies, we have established protection programs and participate in various local initiatives together with suppliers. in this way, we want to support a sustained recovery in monarch butterfly populations. we are working to ensure that the growth of the wild plants (milkweed/as- clepias) that constitute the monarch butterfly's main source of food is supported along its migration routes outside of cultivated areas. through an app called habitally that we developed together with iowa state university, farmers and landowners can document the habitats they have created for monarch but- terflies and track the gains made in milkweed (asclepias) stems/acres across the united states. the app allows for better estimates of how much and where current habitat ex- ists, as well as better facilitating analysis of gaps and oppor- tunities for further habitat development. this benefits not only monarchs, but also many other insects, birds and mammals. the united states fish and wildlife service uses the data to better assess and monitor the population dy- namics of the monarch butterfly. for more information, please see our website. disposal of containers and old inventories, discontinuation policy empty crop protection product containers must be safely disposed of to ensure that the product residues that possi- bly remain are not released into the environment

differently in many countries, the crop protec- tion industry works together with authorities, distributors and farmers to establish or maintain suitable disposal sys- tems. supports programs worldwide to ensure the safe re- cycling and disposal of empty packaging and containers. users can learn about how to safely dispose of our products through information on their labels. processes are in place at to ensure the safe sale-off of products, including the disposal of obsolete inventories or waste. for more in- formation, please see chapter 8.4 waste and recycling. we support the safe disposal of empty crop protection product containers in many countries together with our croplife international industry association, enabling the col- lection of 800,000 metric tons of plastic since 2005. this partnership has also facilitated the development of environ- mentally friendly packaging design programs, the implemen- tation of training courses for distributors and farmers in the proper handling of crop protection product containers, and the testing of plastic recycling options. especially successful disposal programs have been established in brazil, canada, france and germany. in brazil, more than 450,000 metric tons of empty crop protection product containers have been disposed of since 2002 through the inpev (national institute for processing empty packages) program. furthermore, in collaboration with croplife international, supports the establishment of disposal systems for crop protection product containers particularly in countries without suitable disposal programs, for example in asia, africa and some latin american countries. in germany, the crop protection industry partnered with agri- cultural wholesalers to develop the voluntary pamira system for disposing of agrochemical packaging materials. crop pro- tection producers cover the costs for collection, logistics and utilization of packaging, while wholesalers provide the collec- tion points. in 2020, around 3,000 metric tons of crop pro- tection product and liquid fertilizer packaging in germany were returned free of charge and disposed of in an environ- mentally friendly manner through the pamira system. 3.7 biodiversity the number one threat to biodiversity is the loss, deteriora- tion and fragmentation of habitats - mainly driven by agricul- tural activities. this is why attention is centered on raw ma- terial production in the primary sector, and particularly agri- culture. at , activities focus on the responsible use of natural resources to conserve and protect ecosystems, species and genetic biodiversity. we have spelled out this stance both in our human rights corporate policy and in our position on conservation and restoration of biodiversity in agriculture and forestry, which we updated in 2020. we are explicitly committed to the u.n. convention on biological diversity and the associated nagoya protocol, as well as the interna- tional treaty on plant genetic resources for food and agri- culture of the fao, which prescribes the balanced and fair division of use of genetic resources. a supplementary cor- porate directive on the nagoya protocol defines the princi- ples for how to manage access to and the use and transfer of genetic resources and/or traditional knowledge through- out the company. in 2020, defined three strategic focus areas in which we plan to concentrate biodiversity preservation efforts: // generating value for farmers who promote biodiversity; // protecting habitats and forests, and // improving the genetic diversity of crops. an interdisciplinary topic biodiversity is an interdisciplinary topic that affects several areas of our company and our value chain. in addition to ac- tive ingredients for pharmaceutical development, the agricul- ture sector benefits especially from biodiversity - while at the same time contributing to its loss. we are aware that our business operations are highly de- pendent on biodiversity and functioning ecosystems, and that they mutually influence each other. that is why we are committed to integrating considerations around biodiversity preservation as comprehensively as possible into our core business and our research and development activities. we are therefore investigating and developing cultivation sys- tems that help to achieve a better balance between produc- tivity and the conservation of biodiversity and habitats. in cooperation projects involving our forwardfarms and nature conservation experts, for example, we research what this balance could look like in various countries, regions and crops. due to its interdisciplinary character, biodiversity impacts various areas of : sustainability report 2020 37 sustainability strategy 1. the company 2.

consumer health // intensive farming - decades of intensification in agricul- ture have led to challenges in the supply chain. with our innovations in plant breeding and crop protection, we promote the efficient use of available land to ensure a se- cure food supply. this reduces the pressure to convert additional natural habitats (such as tropical forests) into farmland. however, natural habitats can only be con- served in coordination with statutory regulations or mar- ket-oriented incentive programs. for more information, please see the chapter focus on: agriculture // plant integrity - there are fears that genetically modified plants could spread throughout the environment and neg- atively impact biodiversity, for example through cross- breeding. for more information, please see the chapter focus on: agriculture. // pollinators - pollination plays a key role in all terrestrial ecosystems. pollinators therefore represent a significant part of worldwide biodiversity. pollination plays an im- portant role in global crop production and in safeguarding nutrition. to minimize risks posed to bees and other polli- nators by our crop protection products, we perform ex- tensive safety testing and risk assessments and imple- ment product stewardship measures. we are actively in- volved in numerous projects and research activities to protect bees and other pollinators. for more information on protecting pollinators and on the effects of our prod- ucts, please see chapter 3.6 crop science. // climate - forest habitats are of central importance for bio- diversity. our forests also play a key role in protecting the climate. with our new position on deforestation and for- est degradation, we want to address its causes within our sphere of influence, as well as in cooperation with our customers in the agriculture and forestry sector and within our supply chains. we also make a detailed state- ment on this in our current report to cdp forest. // for , digital farming is another important tool for creating a better balance between productivity and con- servation. the goal of digital farming is to use resources such as water, fertilizer and crop protection products more efficiently and sustainably. this also indirectly helps to protect biodiversity. for more information, please see chapter 3.6 crop science. 3.8 pharmaceuticals and consumer health // when planning new production sites, takes into ac- count that they must not be set up in areas that are stat- utorily protected with regard to their natural characteris- tics, biodiversity or other factors. the locations and com- position of our sites has changed due to corporate acqui- sitions and divestments. using the international integrated biodiversity assessment tool (ibat), we therefore con- ducted an updated comparison of the geographical coor- dinates of our 553 production and research sites (includ- ing breeding stations) in 2020 with those of internationally recognized protected areas (such as asean heritage, wetland of international importance according to the ramsar convention, specially protected areas of medi- terranean importance according to the barcelona con- vention, unesco-mab biosphere reserve and world heritage site). the comparison showed that 30 of our sites are located within six kilometers of such protected areas. commitment we support the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources as well as food security and ecological sustainability - not just through financial contributions and donations, but also through material donations to establish new collections aimed at conserving the genetic diversity of crops. we engage in various projects worldwide in this re- spect, including especially the buildup of capacities particu- larly in farming communities, and also participate in numer- ous public-private partnerships. quality and safety of pharmaceuticals and medical devices extremely stringent safety standards for patients and medi- cal professionals apply to pharmaceuticals and medical de- vices. that's why both the development and manufacture of pharmaceuticals and medical devices are subject to very strict quality requirements. the quality management system of the pharmaceuticals and consumer health divisions is based on internationally recog- nized standards and applicable legal, regulatory and ethical requirements for all stages of the provision of a pharmaceu- tical or a medical device - from development to registration, production and distribution. these standards particularly in- clude the rules for good working practices (gxp) in the de- velopment and manufacture of pharmaceuticals - such as good manufacturing practices (gmp), good distribution practices (gdp) and good clinical practices (gcp), cer- tifications like those for the manufacture of medical devices (e.g. , 17025 and 13485) and the guidelines of the ich (international conference on harmonization of technical requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use). internal experts and external assessors regularly conduct risk-based audits to verify compliance with the statutory re- quirements and relevant standards in development and pro- duction as well as for registered product specifications. such audits also cover institutes subcontracted by , service providers, our suppliers and contract manufacturers. observations made during these audits are systematically evaluated and compliance with corrective measures verified at regular intervals. the quality requirements derived from regulatory requirements, permits sustainability report 2020 38 sustainability strategy 1. the company 2. corporate governance 3. product stewardship 4. procurement 5. human rights 6. employees 7.

integrated into our quality management system. in addition to the internal quality assurance mechanisms, all our sites are regularly inspected by the health authorities of the respective countries to verify compliance with the vari- ous national and international requirements and certified ac- cording to the respective product category (e.g. through gmp certificates or in the form of an official producer per- mit). all our sites received the targeted certifications in 2020. the active ingredient is then used to produce a dosable and safe pharmaceutical. the requirements of the active ingredi- ent and the product's acceptance by patients both play a role when developing a suitable delivery form (such as a tab- let or ointment). it must also be ensured that patients can safely dose and easily handle the product. before the pharmaceutical can then be submitted for ap- proval, its efficacy, safety and tolerability must be examined in various phases (phases i-iii) of preclinical and clinical trials. clinical trials clinical trials are an essential tool for determining the effi- cacy and safety of new drugs before they can be used to di- agnose or treat diseases. the benefits and risks of new me- dicinal products must always be scientifically proven and well documented. yet clinical trials are also necessary to ex- amine already approved products for new indications. with respect to clinical trials we strictly align ourselves to the declaration of helsinki, an ethical standard in place since 1964 that regulates research conducted on humans. this commitment is established in our human rights pol- icy and also applies to all research institutes (clinical re- search organizations, cros) tasked with conducting clinical trials on our behalf. additional statutory regulations, direc- tives and ethical codes supplementing the declaration of helsinki have been further developed and introduced world- wide to ensure that the health and safety of participants are the top priority in clinical trials. quality, safety and efficacy are always assessed relative to the possible risks associated with a product's use. such an assessment results in a benefit-risk profile, which is crucial for the product's approval and is also continuously reviewed thereafter. accordingly, the pharmaceuticals and consumer health divisions assess the medical benefit-risk profile of their pharmaceuticals and medical devices throughout their entire product life cycle. for medical devices, the initial pro- duction and subsequent update of the benefit-risk profile are undertaken within the scope of the quality management sys- tem. for pharmaceuticals, this takes place through a corre- sponding pharmacovigilance system. safety in pharmaceutical development and production drug development is a complex and time-consuming pro- cess and is subject to stringent rules. the first step in developing a pharmaceutical is to find sub- stances that can serve as a starting material for a new active ingredient. the next step is to test the new active ingredient - for example by simulating processes, conducting tests in cell or tissue cultures or with the help of bacteria or animal studies. these tests are prescribed by law and subject to strict guidelines and governmental controls. for more infor- mation, see chapter 3.4 animal welfare. clinical trial phases stringent scientific and ethical principles apply for all clini- cal trials involving humans. a trial protocol lays out what is to be investigated, how the trial is to be conducted and why it is necessary. it is approved by the pharmaceutical regulatory authorities and an independent ethics commis- sion. the voluntary trial participants are comprehensively informed in advance about the planned trial and the pos- sible risks. their participation is subject to written consent that can be retracted at any time. they receive an ex- pense allowance for participating. in phase i, physicians investigate an active ingredient with respect to its safety, tolerability and behavior in the body of healthy trial participants. blood values and addi- tional parameters are monitored, and it is determined how the ingredient is taken up, distributed, metabolized and excreted by the human body. in further studies, the physi- cians investigate interactions with other pharmaceuticals or food. if an active ingredient proves to be well tolerated in this phase, it is subsequently tested in trial participants. active ingredients for cancer treatment are tested in pa- tients already in phase i. in phases ii and iii, physicians examine how effective the ingredient under investigation is, if at all, what dose is ideal for treatment and how frequently side-effects occur. phase ii involves the participation of 100 to 500 patients, while the drug product is tested in as many as several thousand patients in phase iii. to rule out distorted measurement results as far as possible, the scientists compare the new active ingredient with an established therapy form or a placebo that does not contain an active ingredient. the patients do not know which group they belong to.

of the active ingredient in the form of a drug product. the trials last for eight years on average. additional clinical studies (phase iv, post-au- thorization safety studies) take place following registration to further assess the benefit-risk profile in the determina- tion of the therapeutic value of the product under practi- cal conditions. wherever in the world we conduct clinical trials, they satisfy these strict international directives and high quality stand- ards, as well as the respective applicable national laws and standards. we review whether they comply with these by means of

globally uniform standards, the monitoring of clinical studies and the role of the ethics committees can be found on the internet. easy-to-understand summaries since 2020, we have published clinical trial results on our trial finder website in a way that is easily understandable. in the future, we plan to publish summaries of each inter- ventional clinical trial after the conclusion of phases i through iv. they are written in english and the eight most important languages worldwide and in the languages of the countries in which the trial was carried out. thus goes well beyond the future requirements of the eu regulation on clinical trials that will enter into force in december 2021. in the case of approved products, summarized results of phase ii, iii and iv clinical trials are accessible online through the trial finder. upon request, scientists can receive access to anonymized data from clinical trials at the patient level via the clinical study data request portal, provided the studies in question are listed in the portal. through this, observes the principles of the european federation approval process the respective documentation submitted to the regulatory authorities contains the research results from the phase i to iii clinical trials and the data generated for a pharmaceutical during its development. it thus includes both the data from the developmental phases, such as chemical-pharmaceuti- cal and toxicological data, and a comprehensive benefit-risk assessment of the pharmaceutical. a new pharmaceutical must comply with all regulatory safety requirements to se- cure marketing authorization. the same applies to medical devices, dietary supplements and medicated skincare prod- ucts. based on these documents, the regulatory authority assesses whether the efficacy, safety and quality of the pharmaceutical have been demonstrated for the intended in- dication. the product is only approved if its benefit-risk ratio is positively assessed. as each country has its own strict regulations for drug de- velopment, product approval and market launch, we work closely with the respective national regulatory authorities to ensure that we act in a compliant manner at every develop- ment stage. the authorities in additional countries often take the assessments of the ema and/or the fda into considera- tion in their own evaluations. the most important regulatory authorities for are: // the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) // the european medicines agency (ema) // the pharmaceuticals and medical devices agency (pmda) in

studies prescribed for pharma- ceutical research investigate drug candidates with regard to their quality, safety and efficacy. at the same time, the gene- sis and progression of a disease differ from one person to another and the effect of a drug product can vary ingly. we continue to observe and evaluate our products fol- lowing their approval and throughout their entire life cycle. this enables adverse effects to be identified at an early stage and a decision to be taken as regards the necessary risk mitigation measures. the collection and evaluation of safety-relevant information about our products are the responsibility of the global pa- tient and drug safety (pharmacovigilance) department, in which scientific and medical experts from various disciplines work together in safety management teams (smts). these teams evaluate internal benefit and safety data, clinical trials, post-marketing studies, external databases and scientific publications to identify potential safety concerns at an early stage and detect possible changes in the benefit-risk profile. all reported side-effects are entered into our pharmacovigi- lance database. the evaluation of information about a bene- fit-risk profile applies not just to pharmaceuticals and medi- cal devices, but also to dietary supplements and medicated skincare products. this information is regularly evaluated to- gether with the regulatory and oversight authorities at both national and international level. as it is particularly important not just to collect data during the clinical development of a medical product, but also to monitor the product after marketing authorization has been granted, we conduct the aforementioned phase iv studies (post-authorization safety studies) to record rare or very rare side-effects, for example. pharmaceutical manufacturers re- ceive reports on side-effects either directly or through the health authorities, as well as through stakeholders such as physicians, pharmacists or patients themselves. we pass on to the regulatory authorities suggestions derived from these reports regarding supplementary safety-relevant information in the package inserts. such suggestions usually come to the authorities from the respective pharmaceutical manufac- turers. the relevant health authorities decide on the steps resulting from the reports and suggestions in close coopera- tion with us as the producer. should risks be identified, we immediately take steps to safeguard the health of patients and consumers in coordina- tion with the authorities. these measures range from updat- ing product information for patients, users, pharmacists and physicians through patient education brochures and further training measures for medical specialists to direct communi- cation with medical experts (direct healthcare professional communication, dhpc) and even product withdrawals. im- plementation of risk mitigation activities is coordinated by our local safety management teams (smts) in the country organizations. all of these processes are documented, regularly updated and integrated into the quality management system. to maintain the high quality of 's pharmacovigilance sys- tem, our medical and scientific experts undergo regular training. furthermore, in line with our product safety and quality: reporting obligations of employees corporate pol- icy, all employees are required to undergo training as regards their obligation to immediately report safety- and quality-relevant information to the pharmacovigilance de- partment. we regularly test whether the pharmacovigilance system can cope with emergency situations such as pan- demics. the information that we compile on side-effects is reported to the national health authorities in the relevant countries, where it is processed. as processes in the european union are centralized, european marketing authorization holders such as are now required to enter all suspected cases of undesirable side-effects directly into eudravigilance, the european medicines agency's electronic information system, rather than reporting them to the 27 national authorities. large data volumes must be analyzed to identify relevant in- formation in the drug safety process. since 2019, has employed technologies with artificial intelligence for this task in order to support time-consuming manual work-flows. this enables side-effects to be discovered at an earlier stage and risk mitigation measures to be implemented faster, which in turn helps to further improve patient safety. pharmaceutical residues in the environment active pharmaceutical ingredients can enter the environment through human excreta, through improper disposal or during production. discharges into surface waters are particularly relevant here. in connection with drinking water that is par- tially taken from surface waters, our current knowledge indi- cates that the existing concentrations of individual active

compre- hensive global report on the drinking water parameter co- operation project (2017), in which the concentrations of pharmaceuticals and mixtures of active pharmaceutical in- gredients in drinking water were investigated among other aspects, the world health organization (who) also does not identify any immediate health risks and consequently sees no need to act in the short term. to further guarantee the safety of drinking water resources, partly against the back- ground of a potential increase in the use of pharmaceuticals, the who recommends that this issue be observed compre- hensively over a longer period of time. furthermore, the impact of pharmaceutical residues on eco- systems is addressed in the public sector and in scientific publications. in 2019, the european commission published a strategic approach to managing pharmaceuticals in the environment. this issue also plays a role in the draft of the eu pharmaceuticals strategy for 2020. between 2015 and 2019, an initiative of the manufacturers' associations efpia (european federation of pharmaceutical industries and as- sociations), aesgp (association europeenne des specialites pharmaceutiques grand public) and mfe (medicines for eu- rope) addressed key points of a strategic approach to deal- ing with pharmaceuticals in the environment and developed possible solutions for this problem. the developed solutions focused partly on expanding the risk assessment processes in connection with the approval of pharmaceuticals and the management of wastewater generated during pharmaceuti- cal manufacturing. the initiative encompasses various pro- jects and concepts, and acted as coordinator of the ipie (intelligence-led assessment of pharmaceuticals in the environment) sub-project. a total of 25 partners from eu- rope and the united states participated in ipie, including 13 major pharmaceutical companies and nine universities and research organizations. the project was established by the innovative medicines initiative (imi), a public-private partner- ship of the european commission and the efpia aimed at developing new models and assessment strategies for pre- dicting the environmental risks of active pharmaceutical in- gredients. a database of environmental information was cre- ated within the scope of ipie that gives a comprehensive, transparent and comprehensible overview of the more than 2,000 compiled studies and the environmental data on ac- tive pharmaceutical ingredients contained therein. research- ers can use the findings gained from the project to develop new pharmaceuticals and thus recognize at an early stage what impact a new drug product might have on the environ- ment. an analysis found that a potential environmental risk is identifiable for only a small number of the active ingredients assessed so far within the scope of central approval pro- cesses. these primarily comprise hormonally active ingredi- ents, which are also used at . we are also a participant in premier (prioritization and risk evaluation of medicines in the environment), a follow-up project initiated with the imi in 2020 that focuses on as- sessing and reducing the risk posed by pharmaceuticals in the environment. the goal is to provide an innovative frame- work for characterizing the environmental risks of active in- gredients that can be used to explore and promote a more environmentally friendly active ingredient design and a more environmentally friendly manufacturing process. is also involved in the stakeholder dialogue initiated by the german government with the goal of drawing up a strat- egy for dealing with trace substances in bodies of water. in round-table formats bringing together stakeholders from management, environmental authorities and associa- tions, health services providers and industry, measures are developed that aim to reduce the discharge of relevant trace substances. the objective is to develop a strategy to pre- vent the water-impacting effects of certain chemicals, in- cluding active pharmaceutical ingredients. we also actively participate in the round table on iodinated x-ray contrast agents. our pharmaceuticals and consumer health divisions carry out ecotoxicological investigations of pharmaceutical resi- dues to assess the potential environmental impact of their active pharmaceutical ingredients. in connection with the approval process for human pharmaceuticals in europe and the united states, an environmental risk assessment of dis- charge following proper use by patients takes place for all new active pharmaceutical ingredients. general information on the environmental risks of pharmaceuticals is given in the specialized information for physicians and in the package in- serts, including details of how to dispose of unused pharma- ceuticals. we take additional action in our production facilities to mini- mize discharges of active ingredients into the environment based on risk-oriented assessment parameters. for more in- formation, please see chapter 8.3 water and wastewater. sustainability report 2020 42 sustainability strategy 1. the company 2. corporate

millions of people in many parts of the world do not have ac- cess to basic medical care. according to the world health organization (who), there are various reasons for this: a lack of medicines, poverty, a lack of or inadequately trained medical personnel, a lack of political will and insufficient ac- cess to medical data. as a leading pharmaceutical company, we believe we have a responsibility to improve access to health care for all. for this reason, we are focusing on areas in which we can have the biggest impact by leveraging our scientific know-how, products, partnerships and global network. in accordance with our sustainability strategy, we want to enable 100 million women in low- and middle-income coun- tries (lmics) to gain access to modern contraceptives by 2030. we also want to facilitate access to self-care prod- ucts and service offerings for 100 million people in under- served communities. for more information, please see the chapter sustainability strategy. it is also our ambition to give 100 million people in lmics access to our pharmaceutical products through fairer drug pricing and our patient access programs. we have implemented strategies for improving access to health care all along the value chain of the pharmaceuticals division. access to medicine index since 2008, the access to medicine foundation has published a ranking of the 20 biggest pharmaceutical companies. the access to medicine index evaluates the companies' measures to make medicines and diagnosis more easily accessible to people in low- and middle-in- come countries (lmics). is currently in 13th posi- tion. family planning the ability of girls and young women to complete their edu- cation and thus improve their opportunities in life is highly dependent on family planning options. for that to happen, they must be able to make their own well-founded decisions about whether to have children, and, if so, how many and when. knowledge about their own sexuality and access to modern family planning are crucial to help young people make important life decisions. furthermore, both education and conversations about family planning strengthen gender equality and the role of women worldwide. that's why ac- cess to voluntary family planning has been an established human right for more than 50 years. family planning plays a crucial role in reducing poverty and hunger, improving health and enabling young people to en- joy a high-quality education. according to the united states agency for international development (usaid), investment in family planning is a \"best buy\" for development that can support the attainment of various sustainable development goals (sdgs). works together with international partners to improve education about sexual rights and contraceptive options. back in 2007, in close cooperation with 15 international partners, we launched the \"your life\" information campaign that is directed toward young people around the world. the associated social media activities provide facts and figures on current contraception options and address concerns about contraceptives. social acceptance of the use of contraceptives presents an obstacle for many women. for this reason, it is important to not only strengthen young people's knowledge, but also to increase awareness among politicians and physicians about the sexual rights of women in low- and middle-income coun- tries (lmics). against this background we have supported the international dialogue on population and sustainable development - an annual conference with participants from civil society, politics and the private sector. access to family planning products is not adequately guar- anteed in many regions of the world. as a leading women's health company, is a longstanding partner to interna- tional family planning programs. 's contraceptive prod- ucts are made available at preferential prices. apart from the use of 's own products, since july 2020, has financially supported the challenge initia- tive (tci) - a family planning program based at johns hop- kins university and implemented by the bill & institute for population and reproductive health. tci aims to quickly and sustainably establish various family planning options on a broad scale. the program is currently being im- plemented in more than 90 asian and african cities. sustainability report 2020 43 sustainability strategy 1. the company 2.

of the reproductive health supplies coalition (rhsc), a global partnership of public, private and nongovernmental organizations. the rhsc endeavors to ensure that people in lmics are able to access affordable and high-quality contraceptives. within the framework of the rhsc, works together with the united nations population fund (unfpa), usaid and inter- national ngos to make available hormonal contraceptives such as birth control pills, three-month injections, implants and coils. as a strategic partner, we also provide support with expertise in the areas of supply, logistics and product registration. we already currently provide contraceptives to 40 million women in low- and middle-income lmics. about half these women are reached through private distribution channels - particularly in higher middle-income markets. the other half - mainly women in countries with lower and lower-middle in- comes - receive access through the international develop- ment network, such as through unfpa or participating na- tional family planning programs. shipments provided through such programs are usually free of charge for the women. to address the challenges linked to facilitating ac- cess to contraceptives over the next decade and reach our target of enabling 100 million women to access modern contraceptives, we will expand our partnerships and in- crease our supply volume in the future. access to self-care solutions we want to enable more people in underserved communities to access self-care products and services in the future. through our nutrient gap initiative, we and our partners want to provide 50 million people in underserved communi- ties with access to vitamins and minerals by 2030. this initi- ative will initially focus on micronutrients for children and pregnant women. only very small amounts of micronutrients are required, but they are essential for the physiological function, growth and development. we have also begun producing new, more affordable pack- aging sizes for our biggest brands that we will offer in vari- ous low middle- and higher middle-income countries throughout the latin america, africa and asia/pacific re- gions. neglected tropical diseases together with other pharmaceutical companies, plays an important role in fighting neglected tropical diseases. for nearly 20 years, we have provided the who with two active ingredients free of charge to treat disease and afri- can sleeping sickness. we also provide funding for logistics and the distribution of these drugs in the affected countries, as well as for other activities. in addition, we are reviewing how we can increase produc- tion capacities to meet the growing need for long-acting re- versible contraceptives (larcs). capacity increases would entail investment in new and existing facilities. for more in- formation, please see our website. according to the who, around 75 million people worldwide are threatened by disease, but less than 1% have access to adequate diagnosis and treatment of the disease, which is why we are continuing clinical and preclinical re- search in this area. in august 2020, a formulation of our product lampittm that is suitable for children was approved by the usfda for the treatment of disease. children are at particular risk because infected, and in some cases asymptomatic, mothers can pass on the pathogen to their unborn children. the new formulation enables the drug to be precisely dosed for children based on body weight. it also has better solubility and is easier to administer, which means it can be given to infants aged zero to two years. that makes this formulation of lampittm the first treatment approved for this age group. we endeavor to reg- ister the active ingredient in further heavily impacted coun- tries and make it accessible for those affected. we also support programs to control the vectors of diseases such as malaria, dengue fever or the zika virus. furthermore, is a member of the european esculab project (european screening centre; unique library for attrac- tive biology) of the innovative medicines initiative (imi), which seeks drugs to effectively treat neglected tropical diseases and malaria, among other objectives. malaria we support various initiatives and organizations in the fight against malaria. as a member of the zero by 40 initiative, we aim, together with other agriculture companies and the bill & foundation, to eliminate the malaria patho- gen by 2040 through the use of innovative vector control, various treatment forms and preventive measures. the foundation supports various partnerships to fight ma- laria in rural regions of asia and africa. sustainability report 2020 44 sustainability strategy 1. the company 2. corporate governance 3. product

noncommunicable dis- eases are a major challenge, particularly in low- and mid- dle-income countries. more than three-quarters of deaths from cardiovascular disease occur in lmics. between 1990 and 2013, sub-saharan africa was the only geo- graphic region in the world to register an increase in deaths due to cardiovascular disease. the number of car- diovascular patients is expected to double by 2030. in ghana, is therefore working in partnership with the german society for international cooperation (giz) and lo- cal health authorities to develop a model project to estab- lish an integrated diagnosis, treatment and continuing edu- cation concept for cardiovascular disease. the ghana heart initiative we support aims to facilitate more specific drug access programs by strengthening the system. the intention is for the model project to serve as a foundation and a catalyst for subsequent initiatives to build up capaci- ties to treat noncommunicable diseases. for more infor- mation, please see our website. and the foundation are similarly committed to numerous projects and local partnerships to strengthen the health system and build up capacities. social commit- ment, access programs and innovative, inclusive business models jointly contribute to the implementation of our \"health for all, hunger for none\" vision. for more infor- mation, please see chapter 9 foundation and charity activities. antimicrobial resistance antimicrobial resistance (amr) is an increasing problem in health care, and suitable antibiotics are urgently needed. together with other pharmaceutical companies, we there- fore support the amr action fund, which aims to bring two to four additional antibiotics to market maturity by 2030 to address amr whose development would other- wise be jeopardized by funding problems. // individual assessment of a patient's ability to pay and ap- plication of a graduated pricing system // provision of the needed medicines at reduced costs, ei- ther through an immediate or delayed discount on the price or through cost-free medicines equitable drug pricing the cost of medicines can present a major obstacle for pa- tients in some countries. we therefore work together with patients, charitable organizations and governmental authori- ties in lmics to improve access to medicines through af- fordable pricing solutions. for some of our most important products (adempastm, eyleatm, mirenatm, nexavartm and xareltotm), we revised the framework conditions for equitable pricing in 2020 to account for per capita gross national in- come. we thereby enable individual decisions to be made about drug prices in the respective countries so that more patients can access the medicines they need. these adjust- ments are also planned for other products. patient access programs our patient affordability programs (paps) help patients in various countries to overcome financial obstacles to treat- ment access. we cooperate with insurance providers, chari- table organizations and other institutions. our paps are de- signed in accordance with the local needs of each country and support patients in different ways: patents in low-income countries in low-income countries (lics), does not register or enforce patents for human pharmaceuticals or vector control products. this applies for as long as a country re- tains the status of a low-income country according to the world bank classification and the country's government does not take any measures that would justify a change in that status. we have also joined the patent information initiative for medicines (), which provides basic patent information on our registered products and makes it available to the public. covid-19 in september 2020, joined with other research-based pharmaceutical companies and the bill & foundation in undertaking to support research into covid- 19 treatments and thus bring the pandemic under control. we are opening up our molecule database to accelerate the search for suitable active ingredients. in addition, when suit- able active ingredients and drugs are found, we cooperate with other pharmaceutical companies to provide adequate production capacities at our facilities as well as warehousing and logistics services to make sure the products can be produced and distributed as quickly as possible. there is a particular focus here on low- and middle-income countries. we are committed to supporting affordable access to effec- tive medicines in these countries. sustainability report 2020 45 sustainability strategy 1.

supply chain. 4.1 management approach the procurement organization supplies the company with raw materials, goods and services all around the world. we exert influence on society and the environment through our procurement activities and supplier relationships. not only economic, but also ethical, social and ecological principles are therefore anchored in our updated procurement policy, which is binding for all employees worldwide. procurement acts on behalf of all divisions and enabling functions, leveraging synergies by bundling know-how and procurement spend. the head of procurement reports di- rectly to the chief financial officer. procurement operates according to established procure- ment and supplier management processes. long-term con- tracts and active supplier management for strategically im- portant goods and services are important elements here. they serve to minimize procurement-specific risks such as supply bottlenecks or significant price fluctuations, and also to safeguard the company's competitiveness and ensure smooth production processes. our main direct procurement materials include active ingre- dients, raw materials, intermediates, finished products and seeds. technical goods and services, marketing services and information technologies are important components of our indirect procurement portfolio. the share of renewable raw materials in 's procure- ment portfolio plays a subordinated role in the group. these materials are primarily used when it makes technical, economic and ecological sense to do so. more information can be found

and supplier diversity. supplier diversity program u.s.a. and brazil with its comprehensive supplier inclusion & diversity pro- gram, promotes diversity within the supply chain in the united states and brazil. in doing so, we account in particular for underrepresented supplier groups such as companies owned or operated by women or members of ethnic minorities. together with chambers of commerce and external organizations, we help these suppliers to fur- ther develop themselves professionally, offer them finan- cial benefits to improve their competitive opportunities and assist them in qualifying for tendering processes. in 2020, was honored for the fourth consecutive time in the united states with the top corporation award of the women's business enterprise national council for the inclusion of suppliers owned by women. in 2021, we in- tend to introduce a new strategy in procurement aimed at promoting the inclusion of and diversity among our sup- pliers. strategic sustainability focus areas works continuously to strategically evolve sustainabil- ity topics in procurement. in the coming years, increasing importance will be placed on environmental and human rights requirements throughout the supply chain and on the supplier inclusion & diversity program. there are also plans to monitor the progress of the various sustainability focus areas using indicators and to define appropriate targets. al- ready in 2020, we stipulated that all strategically important suppliers must present an ecovadis assessment of at least 45 of 100 points (\"green\" assessment) or a comparable au- dit result. beginning in 2021, all potential new suppliers with a procurement spend of more than EUR250,000 will be addi- tionally examined in advance with regard to sustainability as- pects. the focus in 2020 was on developing the strategic and op- erational approaches for respecting human rights and re- ducing the carbon footprint in the supply chain. in the agriculture industry, seed producers are subject to particular risks, especially with regard to respecting human rights. we shall place greater emphasis on this aspect in the future as we develop our new human rights strategy (for more information, please see chapter 5 human rights) and the sustainability risk classification. starting in 2021, we plan to expand our measures with respect to the fulfilment of cor- porate due diligence in the area of human rights in the sup- ply chain and more intensively integrate them into our pro- curement processes. within the framework of 's sustainability strategy, procurement is also responsible for all measures aimed at reducing the carbon footprint of our supply chain (scope 3). in 2020, we launched our activities in this regard and regis- tered initial progress in preparing the future implementation of a scope 3 reduction among our suppliers. for more infor- mation, please see chapter 7 climate protection. 4.2 sustainability in the supply chain clear, sustainability-oriented criteria and standards apply to our supply chain at both a global and regional level. a four- step process is established throughout the company to im- prove sustainability practices in the supply chain. this process is centrally steered by the sustainability unit in procurement. it is implemented through cross-functional co- operation between the procurement; health, safety & envi- ronment; and public affairs, science & sustainability ena- bling functions. we use targeted measures to train our procurement employ- ees in our sustainability requirements. from 2021, we will schedule advanced training on our new sustainability focus topics. sustainability report 2020 47 sustainability strategy 1. the company 2. corporate governance 3. product stewardship 4.

improve sustainability practices in the supply chain raising awareness selecting suppliers for evaluation evaluating sustainability performance developing suppliers step 1: raising awareness the core principles of our sustainability requirements are es- tablished in 's supplier code of conduct, which is based on our human rights policy, the principles of the u.n. global compact and the core labor standards of the international labour organization (ilo). the code is available in 12 languages and covers the areas of ethics, re- lations with employees and other stakeholders (including hu- man rights), health, safety, environment and quality, and governance and management systems. in our supplier code of conduct, we state that complaints and (compliance) vio- lations can be reported - anonymously if desired - via a central compliance hotline set up by that is available worldwide (for more information, please see chapter 2.5 compliance). additionally, we expect our suppliers to make an adequate complaint mechanism available to their stake- holders. the code is applied in the selection and evaluation of our suppliers and is integrated into electronic ordering systems throughout the group. as a result, suppliers must al- ready commit to our core principles upon registration. , our standard supply contracts (with the exception of existing contracts of the acquired agricultural business) contain a clause that authorizes us to verify suppliers' com- pliance with our sustainability requirements. for the existing supplier contracts in the acquired agricultural business, this clause will be successively integrated beginning in 2021 as the contracts are updated. our code of conduct is supple- mented by a global guidance document, which, like the supplier code of conduct, is integrated into our registration portal for suppliers. step 2: selecting suppliers for evaluation each year, systematically selects suppliers whose of the code requirements needs to be reviewed through an online assessment or an audit. the first step is to identify all suppliers of strategic relevance to who must automatically undergo a sustainability evaluation. in the second step, gives a sustainability risk classifi- cation to any remaining suppliers representing a significant annual procurement spend of more than EUR0.5 million. as this threshold was fixed at EUR1 million in 2019, the number of suppliers requiring evaluation increased in 2020. the sus- tainability risk classification comprises the assessment of risks prevailing in the respective supplier's country (country risk) and resulting from the supplier's sector of activity (cate- gory risk). this process was revised in 2020 with the sup- port of an external consultancy, enabling a more detailed view of the risks in the categories of environment (e.g. cli- mate and energy), social standards (e.g. child labor) and corporate governance (e.g. data protection). this more tar- geted analysis by individual risk criteria increases transpar- ency in our supply chain. the risk categorization is based on an internationally recognized classifications of country risks such as those applied by the world bank and of category risks such as those employed by the united nations. sustainability report 2020 48 sustainability strategy 1. the company 2. corporate governance 3. product stewardship 4. procurement 5. human

identi- fied in these two steps and selects the final suppliers requir- ing evaluation. in 2020, this selection process yielded 220 strategically important suppliers making up nearly 25% of the total procurement spend, and 434 suppliers with an in- creased sustainability risk and a significant procurement spend (> EUR0.5 million p.a.). the online assessment criteria of ecovadis - broken down into the areas of environment, ethics, labor practices and human rights, and sustainable procurement - correspond to the requirements of our code and also take into account country- and industry-specific conditions and supplier size. in total, our service provider ecovadis assessed 670 (2019: 650) suppliers on our behalf in 2020. also included in the evaluation process are suppliers for which evaluations were performed through our together for sustainability (tfs) industry initiative and the pharmaceutical supply chain initiative (psci), in addition to those who have proactively allowed themselves to be evaluated. these initia- tives should lead to a standardization of the sustainability re- quirements that suppliers in the chemical and pharmaceuti- cal industries are expected to meet. the exchange and mu- tual recognition of evaluation and audit results should also create synergies within the respective initiatives. step 3: evaluating sustainability performance verifies the observance of the code requirements by the suppliers selected in step 2 by means of ecovadis online assessments or through on-site audits or, during the covid-19 pandemic, virtual audits conducted by both ex- ternal and auditors. in 2020, we also arranged for 26 (2019: 62) of our suppliers to be audited on site by external, independent auditors. in addition, five suppliers were audited virtually due to the global covid-19 pandemic. the audit criteria included both the specifications of our code and the industry-specific re- quirements of the tfs and psci industry initiatives. in 2020, psci carried out a virtual training course for auditors in the areas of health, safety and environmental protection (hse) as well as labor and human rights. furthermore, internal and external auditors evaluate selected new and existing suppliers with a focus on hse. these au- dits are performed for suppliers with significant risk potential as regards, for example, substances, production processes, occupational safety or environmental factors, as well as for toll or contract manufacturers with an increased country risk. in 2020, 83 (2019: 103) suppliers were evaluated by means of hse audits.

those requesting companies to disclose the origin of certain raw materials. this applies, for example, to conflict minerals. when surveying our relevant suppliers, we use the interna- tionally recognized conflict minerals reporting template to identify the use, sources and origin of certain minerals in our supply chain. we communicate in our supplier code of conduct that our suppliers have to ensure that products supplied to do not contain metals derived from miner- als or their derivatives originating from conflict regions that directly or indirectly help to finance or support armed groups and cause or foster human rights abuses. suppliers who do not meet these requirements are immediately notified that these standards must be complied with and suitable measures initiated.

rela- tionship due solely to sustainability performance. our monthly monitoring shows that 357 (2019: 332) of the 701 (2019: 712) suppliers evaluated in 2020 improved their sustainability performance. a supplier receives a critical result if a serious violation or several major findings in sustainability performance are identified. in these cases, requests that the suppliers remedy the identified weaknesses within an appropriate timeframe based on specific action plans. in 2020, this ap- plied to 13 suppliers (2% of all assessed and audited sup- pliers; 2019: 2% (11)). we monitor the implementation of these activities by way of re-assessments or follow-up au- dits. a key factor in this collaboration is helping our suppliers to improve their sustainability performance. here we focus both on remedying deficiencies and on collaborating on sus- tainability topics. to focus more closely on supplier develop- ment, in 2020 we expanded our sustainability team in pro- curement. procurement employees primarily in countries with an increased sustainability risk such as china, india and brazil help to develop suppliers at the local level. the focus here is on local sustainability risks. the industry initiatives tfs and psci also organized virtual training courses and workshops for suppliers in india and china in 2020. through the tfs supplier academy and the psci online resource library, the respective initiatives offer additional advanced training modules for our suppliers that are being expanded each year. in 2020, that included new webinars on human rights risks and a new psci online plat- form for suppliers featuring training courses, resources and tools. the tfs initiative continues to test the usability of a collabo- ration platform involving suppliers as another element of supplier development. it provides users with numerous best-practice examples and dialogue opportunities, as well as activities, tips, case studies and expert suggestions on the topics of water, energy and waste. sustainability report 2020 50 sustainability strategy 1. the company 2. corporate governance 3. product stewardship 4. procurement 5. human rights 6. employees 7. climate protection 8. environmental protection and safety 9. foundation activities 5.1 management approach human rights is a founding member of the u.n. global compact and respects the universal declaration of human rights. we support the u.n. guiding principles on business and human rights, which are among the most important international standards for preventing and combating possible human rights violations in connection with business activities, and globally recognized declarations applicable for multinational corporations. these include the oecd guidelines for multi- national enterprises, the tripartite declaration of principles concerning multinational enterprises and social policy of the international labour organization (ilo), and the latter's core labor standards. 5.1 management approach fully supports human rights and has documented its stance in a globally binding human rights policy. we are committed to respecting and fostering human rights within our own business activities and in business relations. furthermore, our life values, base principles and corpo- rate compliance and fairness and respect at work corpo- rate policies establish how all employees worldwide must conduct themselves fairly and in a compliant manner in deal- ings with colleagues, business partners and members of the community. we also expect our business partners, and particularly our suppliers, to fully observe human rights. we expect our sup- pliers to comply with the requirements of our supplier code of conduct, which is based on our human rights pol- icy, the principles of the u.n. global compact and the core labor standards of the ilo. human rights are among the responsibilities of the chairman of the board of management. in his role as chief sus- tainability officer, he is supported as regards the topic of human rights by the ethics and social impact team of the public affairs, science & sustainability enabling function. the implementation of our human rights standards in busi- ness operations is regulated by corporate regulations, pro- cesses and management and monitoring systems. we use a group-wide, integrated risk management system to identify potentially detrimental effects of our business ac- tivity on human rights. the risk universe is regularly reviewed and, if necessary, updated. the increase in internal and external requirements as regards human rights is re- flected in our risk management. we are currently focusing on further developing our human rights strategy. the first step in this process was to work with an external consulting company to analyze the status quo in our own company and along the entire value chain, aligning this to the u.n. guiding principles on business and human rights. on the basis of this, we aim to introduce in 2021 a comprehensive, long-term strategy for respecting human rights. 5.2 implementation measures we implement measures to ensure respect for human rights both within our own company and along our entire value chain. child and forced labor are strictly prohibited at in accordance with the core labor standards of the ilo. the binding nature of this global ban is established in both our human rights policy and our supplier code of conduct. in line with the conventions of the ilo, only offers fixed-term internships and education programs to young people when this does not impair their safety, health and compulsory school attendance in any way and compliance with the requirements is precisely monitored. if there are indications of violations of our human rights policy, employees and members of the general public can contact the worldwide compliance hotline, which is avail- able in 115 national languages. this can also be done anon- ymously if desired. alternatively, employees can also report suspected violations to the respective compliance functions or to the internal audit unit. we offer ongoing training programs to enhance employees' awareness of the importance of human rights in their day-to- day activities. in 2020, more than 80% of our employees re- ceived training on aspects of our human rights policy in sessions totaling more than 190,000 hours. aspects of hu- man rights are also covered in the training offerings and the sustainability manual for our suppliers. we verify the observation of human rights at our sites and by our suppliers, including by means of audits. in 2020, our auditors identified a limited number of violations against applicable worktime regulations and established minimum wages in our supply chain. in each of these cases, we actively cooperated with our suppliers to improve the sit- uation for employees in a timely fashion. for more infor- mation, please see chapter 4 procurement. sustainability

together with an external partner. the results of this risk assessment are expected to be avail- able in 2021 and will be accounted for in our updated hu- man rights policy. in conjunction with the publication of this new corporate policy in 2021, we will offer special training in human rights for all employees. challenges in the supply chain as regards the topic of human rights, we are focusing es- pecially on our supply chains because they connect us with several million \"rights holders\" - in other words people who are directly or indirectly impacted by our activities. procurement undertakes a classification of the sustainabil- ity risk of our suppliers for this purpose. this risk classifi- cation encompasses all procurement countries and cate- gories such as services and seed production, the latter also including seasonal workers. this process, which we revised together with an external partner in 2020, enables us to identify human rights risks by country and category. that in turn allows us to address these risks more directly in the future. for more information, please see chapter 4 procurement. in its supply chain management activities, undertakes to achieve transparency in the fight against modern slavery. for more information, please see our modern slavery act statement. the risk of human rights violations poses a particular chal- lenge for in the seed supply chain. the focus here is on the risk of child labor. combating child labor our position on child labor is quite clear - it is not tolerated at . the employment of children in farming represents a high risk outside our own operations. we therefore obli- gate our suppliers to strictly refrain from employing children. through our child care program, for years has taken systematic action to prevent child labor in the seed supply chain. the program is established in india, bangladesh and the philippines - the countries in which we identified the po- tential for child labor infractions through our risk assessment. through our child care program, we raise awareness about this problem among our suppliers and clearly communicate our requirements. it involves systematic and repeated in- spections of individual seed producers in their fields by local employees during the growing season. as an addi- tional quality control measure, a special team from in- dia carries out sample inspections in the fields in india, bangladesh and the philippines, in addition to a general pro- cess and documentation review. despite the restrictions associated with covid-19, local teams continued their field inspections wherever possible, while observing the safety precautions. in this context, it was determined that the incidence of child labor in india had in- creased due to return migration of the rural population and the enor- mous challenges associated with the pandemic. it was not possible to conduct sample inspections in the philippines and bangladesh in 2020 due to travel restrictions. in 2019/20, we uncovered a total of 14 cases of child labor among our seed suppliers in india (see table). no cases of child labor were identified in bangladesh and the philippines over the same period. we measure the success of our comprehensive program in india using the indicator \"child labor incidence in relation to the total number of laborers monitored in seed produc- tion for .\" child labor incidence in relation to the total number of labor- ers monitored in seed production for taking india as an example1 child labor incidence total laborers monitored child labor

closely track them through the measures related to our child care program. we visit the parents of children we find working in the fields to specifi- cally convince them of the advantages of school education. graduated sanctions are also applied for noncompliance by our suppliers. these range from written warnings to termina- tion of the contract in the case of repeated noncompliance. by contrast, suppliers who can verify that they strictly ob- serve our ban on child labor receive a bonus such as incen- tive payments. thanks to a stringent monitoring system and the support of local information and educational initiatives, there are very few instances of child labor among seed pro- ducers. continuously raising awareness about child labor in the agri- culture sector requires extensive measures and the involve- ment of various stakeholders. against this background, joined with other seed companies back in 2019 to es- tablish the enabling child and human rights with seed or- ganizations (echo) initiative. echo is one of the biggest multi-stakeholder forums for the promotion of children's rights and decent work - which includes fair wages as well as healthy and safe working conditions. is repre- sented on the initiative's executive committee and currently holds its presidency. the initiative was launched in hydera- bad, india, in 2020 with the first multi-stakeholder consulta- tion on decent workplace standards in the seed supply chain. 5.3 commitment we engage in dialogue with other stakeholders on the topic of human rights and actively participate in committees and initiatives established to ensure their observance, for exam- ple by contributing to discussions on implementing the na- tional action plan (nap) \"business and human rights\" in germany, in the corresponding working groups of econ- sense and, in the supply chain, via our tfs industry initiative and the pharmaceutical supply chain initiative (psci). in 2020, we also joined the business for social responsibility (bsr) initiative and its working group for human rights. the member companies from various industries discuss best practices, challenges and experiences in implementing the u.n. guiding principles on business and human rights. learning for life as school attendance is essential for children's develop- ment, regards this as an effective tool for prevent- ing child labor. that's why the learning for life initiative is an integral part of our child care program in india: with advanced training measures in farming, we help disad- vantaged young people gain the skills and knowledge needed for modern agricultural vocations and prepare themselves for advanced agricultural employment in vil- lages or companies. the young people who have com- pleted the training program serve as role models for other children to continue pursuing their school education. in combination with the early child education program im- plemented between 2005 and 2012/2013, we reached more than 7,000 children and young people with our learning for life activities through 2020. this number in- cludes the more than 1,100 school students who suc- cessfully completed the career-oriented program between 2010 (the year of launch) and 2020. also actively participates in the discussion on due dili- gence with respect to human rights. together with a part- ner, we organized a virtual multi-stakeholder event in the fall of 2020 to discuss a potential framework for human rights due diligence at eu level. for more information on our cooperation with other seed companies within the enabling child and human rights with seed organizations (echo) initiative, please see chapter 5.2 implementation measures. human rights: an interdisciplinary topic

older employees. through the bayzeit long- term account, furthermore, employees in germany can con- vert part of their gross salary already in the early years of their employment into free time that they can later take off. restructuring measures we act with social responsibility when changes and restruc- turing measures are necessary. for example, we will com- plete the worldwide reduction of around 12,000 jobs initi- ated in late 2018 by the end of 2021 following local laws and regulations, meaning that there may be different solu- tions in different countries. in all countries we aim to mini- mize the impact on employees and find mutually agreeable solutions in cases where job reductions are necessary. the safeguarding 's future 2025 general works agree- ment fundamentally rules out dismissals for operational rea- sons for the intercompany personnel network of ag in germany until the end of 2025. 6.3 fair compensation as a global enterprise, enacts uniform standards to ensure that employees are fairly compensated throughout the group. our performance and responsibility-related com- pensation system combines a basic salary with perfor- mance-related elements, plus additional benefits. adjust- ments based on continuous benchmarking make our com- pensation internationally competitive. we attach great importance to equal pay for men and women, and to informing our employees transparently about the overall structure of their compensation. our total re- wards corporate directive provides a binding framework specifying the global requirements. we initiated a gender pay parity analysis in 2020 that com- pares the compensation of our female and male employees in comparable positions and within the same country. we will report on the results once the analysis has been com- pleted. we made further progress with the planned group-wide measures in 2020. in total, around 10,700 positions have been shed through these measures. flexible models with attractive conditions have been offered to employees of various age groups since february 2019. more than 2,200 employees in germany have accepted such a voluntary severance agreement since it was introduced. further measures with regards to the acceleration of our transformation announced in september are currently be- ing developed. living wages compensates employees on both permanent and temporary employment contracts in excess of the statu- tory minimum wage in the respective countries, paying at least a living wage that is annually reviewed and specified worldwide by the nonprofit organization business for so- cial responsibility (bsr). this also applies to part-time employees whose compensation was proportionately aligned with that of a full-time position. the payment of living wages is implemented at the country level and re- viewed each year by the hr enabling function to ensure that the requirements of the bsr are observed through- out the group. a living wage is defined as the wage that is required to purchase the goods and services needed to meet a mini- mum cultural and social standard of living in a country - including basic needs such as accommodation, energy and food, but also leisure activities, cultural participation and a savings rate. in other words, the concept of a living wage goes beyond the otherwise customary statutory minimum wage. in addition, living wages are adapted an- nually to changing conditions in specific countries, while statutory minimum wages usually remain unchanged for several years. although minimum wages are legally estab- lished in many countries, they often are not sufficient to enable a living standard above the poverty line. by inte- grating the living wage concept into our operations, we also support the universal declaration of human rights and the global sustainable development goals (sdgs) of the united nations. sustainability report 2020 58 sustainability strategy 1. the company 2. corporate

compensation structures at at , individual salaries are based on each employee's personal and professional abilities and the level of responsi- bility assigned to them. at the managerial level, this is based on a uniform evaluation approach for all positions through- out the group using the internationally recognized hay method. in areas of the group and jobs covered by a binding collective bargaining agreement, there are no differ- ences in pay based on gender. in the emerging markets and developing countries, compensation levels are aligned to lo- cal market conditions. in the majority of cases, full- and part-time employees at our significant locations of operation receive the same rates of fixed and variable pay. our compensation concept also in- cludes variable one-time payments to recognize outstanding performance. in many countries, employee stock programs enable our staff to purchase shares at a discount. de- pending on statutory requirements, employees on temporary contracts may not be entitled to long-term compensation components such as pension plans in some countries. be- ginning in 2021, the variable compensation of our upper managerial employees will also take into account the attain- ment of the group's sustainability targets. for more infor- mation, please see the 2020 annual report. retirement benefits alongside providing attractive compensation for their work, contributes to the financial security of its current and former employees. retirement benefit plans are available to 71% of employees worldwide to complement national pension systems. the benefits provided depend on the le- gal, fiscal and economic conditions in each country, em- ployee compensation and years of service. availability of retirement benefit plans1 % europe/middle

bundle our group-wide continuing educa- tion offerings in the academy, which offers profes- sional training for all employees and has received numerous international awards. full- and part-time employees, as well as contingent workers, complete required compliance and job-specific related training through in-person and web- based courses. the leadership academy offers courses designed to systematically develop managerial employees. the courses accompany the managers from their first leadership roles to future duties in upper management. since 2018, our employees have also been able to access a comprehensive elearning library that is available at any time without commitment to defined course times. all employees can access  suitable for their needs and put to- gether an individually tailored learning plan in line with their development requirements. the courses are free of charge for full-time and part-time employees, and approval by su- pervisors is not required. in this way, we are meeting mod- ern workplace learning requirements and creating a sound infrastructure for standardized qualification throughout the group. the elearning library currently includes more than 27,000 courses and offers not just specialized  for individual occupational groups and disciplines, but also overarching themes for a broad target group within the com- pany. to further expand the range of available courses, we have provided our employees with access to an additional external learning platform since december 2020 at which they can take courses that are updated each month. learning and training hours amounted to 27.7 hours per employee in 2020. the average cost of ongoing training per employee was EUR481. learning and training hours by employee group and gender 2020 functional academies such as the innovation academy, it academy and r&d academy offer advanced training for em- ployees in various disciplines. our employees can further enhance their specialist knowledge

embarking on a career and internships for students around the world. 6.5 employee development and integration promotes a culture of candid feedback and encour- ages feedback in all directions: from supervisors to employ- ees, between colleagues and from employees to supervisors. our managerial employees serve as role models and play an important part in promoting performance and further devel- oping the feedback culture at . supervisors have the opportunity to ask their team for feedback about their lead- ership behavior. the leadership pulse feedback tool helps them to understand how their team perceives them in their role as a manager. in 2020, 's new virtual mentoring approach became available to all full-time and part-time employees globally, enabling our people to leverage mentoring self-directly as an opportunity to develop themselves and others. the program is supported by an algorithm based on artificial intelligence that brings together mentors and mentees from throughout the group. since the launch, more than 2,400 em- ployees have registered; 47% of participants are women and 53% are men. performance targets and development dialogue our employees and supervisors jointly set flexible annual tar- gets. in consultation with their supervisors, employees can select targets of relevance for themselves and their work , as well as make flexible adjustments to the targets dur- ing the evaluation phase. both individual and team targets can be set. in 2020, 72% of eligible employees set flexible annual targets, 43% of these female and 57% male. 79% of our employees (66% of our specialists and 99% of our managers) can participate in a year-end evaluation con- cerning the fulfillment of the targets they set for themselves. at the end of 2020, 97% of the entitled employees (43% fe- male and 57% male) received an evaluation concerning the fulfillment of the targets they set for themselves. in addition, employees can regularly and openly discuss their perfor- mance, challenges, ideas and well-being with their supervi- sors in so-called check-ins. managerial employees throughout the group have the op- tion of presenting top performance awards to reward out- standing individual and team successes. these involve a variable payment to reward employees directly in a timely fashion. additional recognition programs are in place in some countries to reward employee performance. in many countries, employees are recognized with years of service awards. thanks to our wide-ranging business activities, employees throughout the group can access various opportuni- ties for development. in regular development dialogues, em- ployees discuss perspectives for their further career devel- opment together with their supervisors. more than 53,000 development dialogues were held and documented in 2020. in total, 52% of our employees participated in the develop- ment dialogues (of which 44% were women and 56% men; in total 44% of our specialists and 64% of our employees in management). vacancies throughout the group, from nonmanagerial right up to upper management level, are advertised via a globally accessible platform. scientists to maintain the

entific experts about their own career development. special mentoring programs are established to support employees' early development and regular networking with experienced scientists and managers. to continue to attract scientists in the future, we are further developing our employment offer- ing and working with specialized recruiting partners to this end. dialogue and exchange our employees have the opportunity to discuss company- specific topics and scope for optimization via various com- munication channels. we actively involve our employees in business processes by offering the opportunity for dialogue. informing staff in a timely manner and comprehensively about upcoming changes, in compliance with the applicable national and international regulations, is very important to us. gri 102-43 sustainability report 2020 60 sustainability strategy 1. the company 2. corporate governance 3. product stewardship 4. procurement 5. human rights 6. employees 7. climate protection 8.

in the enabling functions. 6.6 work-life integration we support our employees in balancing their work and pri- vate lives. to take their individual situation into account, we therefore give them the opportunity to flexibly shape their working hours and work locations and offer them parental leave and support in childcare and caring for close relatives. in many countries, our commitment in this area goes beyond the statutory requirements. an overview of the offers in each country can be found online. the next normal in response to the covid-19 pandemic, perma- nently expanded the flexible shaping of working hours and work locations for the employees and thus created a \"next normal\" in this regard. this makes it easier for the employees to meet both their work responsibilities and their private obligations. it also helps keep our employees safe and limit the spread of the pandemic. the increased use of flexible working models is part of our next normal, in which our employees are given more flexibility and re- sponsibility at all hierarchy levels (empowerment). in com- pliance with the requirements of (labor) law and consider- ing cultural differences, we want to account for the needs of our employees and our customers and thus strengthen our business operations. we engage in open and trustful dialogue with employee rep- resentatives worldwide. the main dialogue formats are regu- lar employee assemblies and information events for manag- ers, as well as the european forum, at which employee rep- resentatives from all european sites engage in discussion with the board of management on topics of overarching rel- evance to the company. our employees can submit -related questions through the internal crowdsourcing platform to solicit inno- vative, interdisciplinary ideas. these are then answered with the help of other employees with whom the person asking the question does not normally have any contact. to promote a culture of innovation in the workplace, addi- tional platforms for making work-related suggestions are available to employees in germany e.g. the ideas pool and the ideas forum. the suggestions made by employees on improving processes, occupational safety and health protection are rewarded and utilized. more than 2,700 ideas were submitted in 2020. 45% of the suggestions for im- provement evaluated in 2020 were implemented. in the first year of implementation alone, those improvements that led to quantifiable benefits generated savings of some EUR3.9 million. in 2020, distributed bonuses of around EUR1.1 million for the implemented proposals. in 2020, part-time employees accounted for around 6.1% of the group workforce (corresponding to 8.3% of our female employees and 4.6% of our male employees), pri- marily in europe. part-time employees by gender ,703 (3,609) men total 6,088 (8,897) 3,384 (5,288) women enables both men and women to take parental leave, although national parental leave regulations vary widely from country to country. 1,755 women and 1,624 men took pa- rental leave in 2020. in the course of the year, 3,022 em- ployees on parental leave returned to work. the next table shows for germany (as an example) the num- ber of employees who have returned to work after selecting the standard statutory parental leave program of up to three years per child. by the end of 2020, 68.4% had returned to work. 54.7% women and 83.3% of men who have taken pa- rental leave since 2018 have returned to work. sustainability report 2020 61 sustainability strategy 1. the company 2.

to work remotely on certain days after consulting with their supervisor. as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, employ- ees made frequent use of mobile working. in addition, through the bayzeit long-term account, employees in ger- many can convert part of their salary into free time, which they can later take off to care for children or close family members, or to take part in an advanced training course, for example. the general works agreement on caring for close relatives helps employees in germany to combine working with their role as caregivers through adapted worktime models and temporary paid leave. 6.7 inclusion and diversity mutual understanding and a company culture that leverages talented employees of various backgrounds and perspec- tives is an important success factor for the group. we create a working environment in which all employees feel welcome and can perform at their best. we want to continue to recruit and promote employees who both have top skills and qualifications and reflect our strong focus on inclusion and diversity. we employ people from around 149 countries. our inclusion & diversity strategy focuses on the integrative behavior and decision-making of all employees within the group. to this end, we have established committees for in- tegration and diversity at various management levels. in the future, we intend to integrate inclusion & diversity into hr processes e.g. in the recruitment and promotion of employ- ees (talent management). promoting inclusion and diversity we want to increase the proportion of women in top man- agement to 33% by 2025. the proportion of women at all further management levels (including upper and lower management) is targeted to increase to 50% by 2025. the goal is to increase the proportion of women in top management to 50% by 2030. we have also defined ad- ditional targets for 2025 and 2030 for further diversity di- mensions including age structure, nationality, experience, lgbtq+ and people with disabilities. further diversity di- mensions such as ethnic background are integrated into the targets for our regional organizations. in 2020, our top-level managers underwent additional train- ing in integrative management and the further development of our talent management with a focus on diversity. for in- formation on the gender pay parity analysis initiated in 2020, please see chapter 6.3 fair compensation. business resource groups the inclusion & diversity strategy also incorporates busi- ness resource groups (brgs), which facilitate ing and thus dialogue and mutual support for employees within the group. the brgs help us to cultivate an inclusive and diverse company culture. brgs currently exist at for women, lgbtq+, employees with disa- bilities, families and other global and regional employee groups, including with respect to ethnic origin. three of our brgs were each assigned a different spon- sor from ag's board of management in 2020. the intent here is for the members of the board of manage- ment to advise and support the brgs as mentors, as well as for the board members to gain a multicultural perspec- tive - and thus further develop inclusion and diversity in our company culture. // blend (brg for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender [lgbtq+] employees and their supporters at ); sponsored by , board of management member

that represents around 2.1% of our total workforce. most employees with disabilities work for our companies in germany, where they made up 4.5% of the workforce in 2020. gender equality advocates the promotion of gender equality. we have endeavored for many years to achieve a better gender balance in management. for that reason, we have set our- selves clear targets that we aim to achieve by 2025. the proportion of women in upper management in 2020 was 36.1%. the proportion of women in the group leadership circle, the highest management level in the group be- low the board of management, increased again compared to previous years. by the end of 2020, it was made up of 23% women (compared to 6.5% as reported in 2010) and 77% men (2010: 93.5%). the group leadership circle cur- rently comprises 35 nationalities, with around 65% of its members working in their native country. since february 2021, the board of management has again had one female member, thus meeting early the target set in 2019. the company's supervisory board should be com- posed of at least 30% women or 30% men. the supervisory board meets this target, with women making up 35%. for more information, please see the declaration by corporate management in the 2020 annual report. as a signatory to the united nations women's empower- ment principles, we pursue an inclusive approach. diversity is integrated into all relevant human resources processes and driven forward by the management. the seven women's empowerment principles sum up how women can be empowered in the workplace, on the employment market and

emissions (scope 1 and 2) by 42% (base year: 2019) in ab- solute terms and partly by offsetting the remaining emissions (scope 1 and 2). we also strive to reduce the relevant emis- sions in our value chain (scope 3) by 12.3% in absolute terms. these reduction goals were confirmed by the sci- ence based targets initiative (sbti). the attainment of these targets is accounted for in the compensation of the board of management and managerial employees. for more infor- mation on our group targets, please see the chapter sus- tainability strategy. commitment to climate we are committed to the objective of the paris agree- ment. as a signatory to the business ambition for 1.5degc initiative, we strive to attain net zero emissions in our en- tire value chain by 2050. in this way, we are helping to protect the health of people, animals and plants, and to conserve ecosystems. we are also dedicated to a climate policy that is in har- mony with our ambitious climate targets. we therefore sup- port decarbonization measures through our membership in industrial associations, whose positions and actions affect- ing climate policy we regularly examine critically. we have set additional targets at crop science to reduce agriculture's carbon footprint, since this currently accounts for about 25% of global emissions. by 2030, we want to help lower greenhouse gas emissions per kilogram of har- vested produce in major agricultural markets by 30%. this applies to the most emissions-intensive crops in the regions where operates. for example, we will support farmers in the use of climate-friendly practices so that they release less co2 thanks to measures such as reduced plowing and the application of digital solutions in their fields. to achieve both the group target of climate neutrality and the science based targets, we will implement various measures in the future in the areas of energy efficiency, en- ergy sources, compensation and value chain: sustainability

we are investing in process innova- tions, more efficient facilities and building technology, as well as the implementation and optimization of energy management systems, particularly at our production sites. we also use an internal co2 price of EUR100 per metric ton when calculating our capital expenditure projects. // worldwide, we will source 100% of our procured electric- ity from renewable energies by 2030. as this electricity is generated without emitting greenhouse gases, its exclu- sive use enables an absolute reduction of our own green- house gas emissions (scope 2). we are focusing here above all on establishing long-term electricity purchase agreements with renewable energy producers that oper- ate close to our sites wherever possible. whenever an electricity supply agreement is not possible, we purchase high-quality green electricity certificates. we are also ex- amining options for producing our own electricity from re- generative energy at our sites. we will not be able to make all our production processes co2 neutral and will still have to use fossil fuels in chemi- cal processes or special manufacturing methods. in this connection, greenhouse gas emissions not only result from combustion, but also through chemical reactions in processes required for engineering reasons. // we will fully offset these unavoidable emissions (scope 1 and 2) by 2030 through certificates from compensation projects, especially in reforestation, forest conservation and agriculture. in selecting projects, we pay particular attention to ensuring that they enable long-term co2 cap- ture (permanence) and that this would not take place without the sale of certificates (additionality). in addition, we have established further internal quality requirements such as the certification of projects according to interna- tionally acknowledged standards. we also give prefer- ence to projects that not only achieve co2 capture, but also provide social benefit for disadvantaged population groups. yet it is also especially important to us to pro- mote biodiversity and water conservation and to prevent the development and spread of deserts. we already off- set 200,000 metric tons of co2 in 2020, for example by financing reforestation and forest conservation projects in uruguay, brazil and china. // to enable a future reduction in the emissions of our up- stream value chain (supply chain, scope 3), we undertook a scope 3 analysis in 2020 to identify relevant reduction potentials. possible implementation measures include giv- ing suppliers incentives to use electricity from renewable energies, further optimizing our logistics and reducing packaging. within the scope of the together for sustaina- bility (tfs) industry initiative, heads up the working group on emissions reduction in the supply chain, which aims to identify possible levers and develop improvement measures. in accordance with the guidelines of the sci- ence based targets initiative (sbti), the calculation of our reduction target for scope 3 emissions takes into account five categories that make up the biggest portion of our scope 3 emissions (88%). we disclose the categories and the associated scope 3 emissions in chapter 7.4 greenhouse gas emissions. 7.3 risk and opportunity analysis in 2020, we looked at the risks and effects of climate change from various perspectives to better evaluate them as regards our company and integrate them into our strategy and measures. climate-related risks are already accounted for in our group-wide enterprise risk management (erm). we plan to further intensify this aspect in the future, in doing so addressing the recommendations of the tcfd. we will conduct a scenario analysis in 2021 based on the in- ternationally acknowledged scenarios ssps (shared socioec- onomic pathways) and (representative concentration pathways) of the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc). this analysis is designed to help us assess the impact of climate change on our business strategy through 2030 and 2050 and to derive relevant decisions. to better prepare for tomorrow's challenges, we are analyzing scenarios both for the achievement of the paris objectives and for global warm- ing of 3.5 degrees celsius. here we distinguish between physical and transition risks and opportunities. short-term (extreme) weather events and long-term climate changes, whose intensity can vary according to region, pre- sent a challenge in particular for the agriculture industry. there are increasing risks of harvest losses and thus for the agricultural value chain as a whole. the crop science divi- sion therefore takes weather and climate aspects into ac- count when evaluating the risks for its business and aligning its business strategy. sustainability report 2020 66 sustainability strategy 1. the company 2. corporate governance 3. product stewardship 4. procurement 5. human rights 6. employees 7. climate protection 8. environmental protection and safety 9. foundation activities 7.4 greenhouse gas emissions with our strategy for achieving climate neutrality and reduc- ing greenhouse gas emissions along a path of 1.5 degrees celsius, we are reducing the risk of possible higher costs as a result of new or more expensive emissions allowances. we continuously analyze the further effects of regulatory re- quirements on our business, such as through the eu green deal. national or international co2 reduction targets could lead to the abandonment of fossil fuels, for example. at the same time, regulatory authorities have been critical of the generation of fuels from biomass (biofuels). depending on the regulators' decision, this could lead to either increased or reduced demand for biofuels. this decision could impact our sales markets, as some of our customers grow corn for the production of biofuels. in addition to risks, however, climate change can also create opportunities for our business. 's product range and innovation capability - particularly in the agricultural value chain - will create a foundation for leveraging new options and sales opportunities in the future against the background of climate change. as one of the world's biggest co2 emit- ters, for example, the agriculture industry can help to pro- tect the climate - for example by capturing co2 in farmland. carbon initiative we launched the carbon initiative in 2020 to attain our target of a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emis- sions from farming by 2030. this underscores the central role that farmers and their fields can play in having a posi- tive long-term environmental impact. encouraging farmers to forgo plowing, precisely determine their nitrogen requirement or utilize cover crops enables greenhouse gas emissions to be lowered and co2 to be better cap- tured in the soil. some 700 farmers in brazil and the united states are participating in the program during the 2020/2021 growing season. in both countries, they will receive support from us in implementing climate-friendly farming processes. for further information, please see our website. all climate models anticipate an increase in extreme weather conditions that present an elevated risk of crop losses and thus risks for the agricultural value chain as a whole. as a seed producer, we therefore want to develop plants with in- creased resistance against such extreme weather condi- tions. that includes short-stature corn that is less suscepti- ble to storms (for more information, please see the chapter focus on: agriculture). we also enable farmers to react bet- ter and more quickly to extreme weather conditions with our fieldview(tm) digital farming platform. for more information, please see chapter 3.6 crop science. the natural-physical effects of climate change are particu- larly relevant for our agricultural products. in addition, health risks such as cardiovascular disease will also intensify in many cases due to hotter summer months or more frequent heatwaves. this could create increased demand for cardio- vascular or nutritional supplements. 7.4 greenhouse gas emissions at , air emissions are primarily caused by the combus- tion of primary energy sources such as gas and oil. these are used to generate electricity, steam and auxiliary energy (such as for heating and cooling) for the production of our products. further emissions derive from chemical processes in which coal and other energy sources are required to pro- duce chemical reactions. emissions are also generated through our vehicle fleet and in the extraction and pro- cessing of raw materials. in reporting greenhouse gas emissions, we take into ac- count the recommendations of the greenhouse gas proto- col (ghg protocol). direct emissions from our own power plants, vehicles, waste incineration plants and production fa- cilities (scope 1) and indirect emissions from the procure- ment of electricity, steam and cooling energy (scope 2) are determined at all environmentally relevant sites whose an- nual consumption exceeds 1.5 terajoules. in line with the ghg protocol, we report indirect emissions (scope 2) according to both the location-based and market- based methods. sustainability report 2020 67 sustainability strategy 1. the company 2. corporate governance 3. product stewardship 4. procurement 5.

address our climate protection activities in our latest re- port to cdp (formerly the carbon disclosure project). in 2020, the group was involved in european emis- sions trading with five plants in

gas emissions. production accounts for the most significant share of our energy requirement, which de- pends on the production operations at the sites and the depth of our value chain (see also chapter 7.4 greenhouse gas emissions). energy consumption when calculating total energy consumption, we differentiate between primary and secondary energy consumption. the main source of primary energy consumed comprises fossil fuels for our own generation of electricity, steam and cooling energy for our own use and to a small extent for sale to other companies. secondary energy consumption reflects the purchase of electricity, steam and cooling energy at our sites worldwide. among the targets we have set within the context of our climate strategy is to cover 100% of purchased electricity needs with renewable energies by 2030. to achieve this objective, we have produced a catalogue of criteria such as physical proximity to the production plant and additionality. for more information, please see chapter 7.2 climate strategy. in 2020, around 6% of our purchased electricity was sourced from renewable energies. around 94% of the electricity orig- inated from other sources, such as fossil fuels or nuclear power. in 2020, we concluded supply agreements for elec- tricity from renewable energies in the united states, mexico, spain and other countries. compared with  petajoules), 's total energy consumption fell by 8.6% to 35.9 petajoules in 2020. this decline is primarily due to the covid-19 pandemic, which has led to reduced production activities at some sites.

production volume: the more that is pro- duced, the greater the energy consumption and also the as- sociated greenhouse gas emissions. energy management systems such as 50001 also help to identify potential energy savings in production processes, as well as when developing new production processes and converting exist- ing ones. this not only conserves valuable energy resources, but also takes into account economic factors associated with long-term savings. in our report to cdp we also de- scribe projects to save energy that were implemented at various sites. energy efficiency reports

protecting the environment and ensuring the safety of our employees and the people who live near our sites. we work continuously to reduce the environmental impact of our business activities and develop product solutions that benefit the environment. 's fo- cus is on taking consistent precautions - to ensure safety in day-to-day work, in the operation of production facilities, and on work-related travel and transportation routes. 8.1 management approach responsibility for steering and monitoring health, safety and environment (hse) aspects across the group lies with the enabling function of the same name, which is, in line with the business allocation plan of the board of management, assigned to the member of the board of management re- sponsible for crop science. the corporate hse enabling function establishes responsibilities, targets, key perfor- mance indicators and framework conditions for the entire group. these include the hse management and hse key requirements corporate policy, which forms an integral part of the global hse management system. this policy de- scribes the basic approach for monitoring hse processes at and defines core hse requirements that need to be implemented worldwide. detailed requirements for individual environmental protection and safety aspects are established in more far-reaching corporate regulations. the continuous review and revision of corporate regulations by the corporate hse enabling function, regular mandatory internal audits and external certification processes ensure that the systems at all sites meet the requirements in each case. hse management systems are integrated into business pro- cesses across the group. operational responsibility for health, safety and environmental protection lies with the individual divisions, which steer hse via management sys- tems, committees and working groups. we report all relevant hse data of the group including all fully consolidated companies in which we have a share of more than 50%, collect data on occupational injuries at all sites worldwide, and record environmental indicators at 220 environmentally relevant production, research and admin- istration sites, compiling this in the -wide site infor- mation system baysis. we consider all sites to be environ- mentally relevant whose annual energy consumption is greater than 1.5 terajoules. our hse commitment extends beyond the scope of legal re- quirements. for capital expenditure projects exceeding EUR10 million, we perform a voluntary ecological assessment. this includes an evaluation of direct and indirect emissions. in the case of acquisitions, we examine compliance with the applicable environmental and occupational safety regula- tions as well as fundamental employee rights at the produc- tion sites in question. through our hse management sys- tems we also avoid damage and disruptions to work and production. hse management systems based on the hse management and hse key requirements corporate policy, which was published in april 2018, all envi- ronmentally relevant sites must introduce an hse management system by march 2021 that complies with rec- ognized international standards (e.g. 14001, 45001 or 50001). by the end of 2025, furthermore, 80% of our business activity should have coverage with external certification to the above standards. standards and certifications % of business activities based on energy consumption of environ- mentally relevant sites 2019 2020 certification to external standards 14001 certification/emas validation 45001 certification/ohsas  certification degree of coverage with certification to at least one of the above standards  hse audits audits are an integral component of our global hse man- agement system. they help to ensure compliance with ap- plicable regulations and to improve our performance world- wide through the management and mitigation of possible hse risks. 's global hse audit program comprises both general hse audits and process and plant safety au- dits. the health, safety and environmental audits corporate directive defines the basic principles and methodology for selection, planning, implementation and post-processing us- ing a risk-based decision-making process.

foundation activities 8.2 air emissions through the overarching hse audit approach, we include all units and apply the same concepts worldwide. when for audit, the focus is particularly on production sites, relevant warehouses, sites with research and development units, relevant seed treatment and processing units and country groups. the frequency of audits is determined taking into account the risk category (based partly on the size of the site or the type of production activity), the performance evaluation (based partly on past audit results, for example) and risk- mitigating measures (e.g. existing certifications), and ranges from two to five years. incident-based audits can be carried out in addition to this. the audit criteria comprise all applicable environmental and safety regulations and stand- ards for the area being audited, including regulations, local hse management system regulations, legally applica- ble standards, permit requirements and international stand- ards (e.g. 14001 or 45001). if deficiencies in com- pliance with legal regulations are identified, additional com- pliance audits can be planned. the respective site management, the division and the head of the corporate hse enabling function are notified of the audit findings. supplementary to the global hse and pro- cess and plant safety audits, sites and country organizations carry out their own internal hse audits or self-inspections according to a specific risk-based approach. since 2020, all global audit reports, and successively the local audit reports as well, have been stored in a new database. 8.2 air emissions air emissions are monitored as part of our environmental management system at the sites. these are partly consid- ered in the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions such as ozone-depleting substances or nitrous oxide (laughing gas). for more information on our greenhouse gas emissions and our energy consumption, please see chapter 7 climate pro- tection. emissions of ozone-depleting substances in 2020 fell signifi- cantly from 12.3 to 4.3 metric tons. emissions of volatile or- compounds were halved. among the reasons for the reduction in both

people, animals and plants. that is why it is crucial that industrial water usage will continue not to lead to local problems such as a short- age of water for the people living in the catchment areas of our production sites. in our water position, we commit to complying with international, national and local legislation to protect water resources, using them as sparingly as possi- ble and further reducing emissions into water. in our water stewardship strategy, we address a variety of factors connected with water, from operational water use and innovative products such as seeds with a reduced requirement to our commitment in the value chain and cooperation with partners. we support the ceo water man- date of the u.n. global compact with the goal of working with key stakeholders to develop sustainable strategies for water usage. we aim to identify potential for improvement particularly at sites located in water-scarce areas or in areas identified as being threatened by water scarcity, and use as little water there as possible. the first step in this process was the analysis of our sites in such areas in 2019, based on the aq- ueduct water risk atlas published by the world resources institute, to establish whether they have a water manage- ment system. this was the case with 95% of these sites. in 2020, we achieved our goal of increasing this to 100% cov- erage of our sites with a water management system. for more information on water sources in water-scarce areas or in areas identified as being threatened by water scarcity, please see the table \"water sourced in water-scarce areas or areas threatened by water scarcity.\" we are currently further developing our water strategy to better address the opportunities and risks associated with water stewardship in the future, especially in view of chang- ing climatic conditions. in our annual response to the cdp water disclosure, we re- port in detail on our water usage and the company-specific water footprint. this represents a progress report for the ceo water mandate. in recent years, including 2020, we have repeatedly been included in the cdp water a list (leadership status). sustainability report 2020

used by is cooling water that is only heated in this process and does not come into contact with products. it can be returned to the water cycle without further treatment in line with the relevant official per- mits. at our production facilities, we endeavor to use water sev- eral times and to recycle it. water is currently recycled by various means at 49 sites, these being responsible for 44.5% of the total water used. these means include closed cooling cycles, reuse of treated wastewater, including to water fields, and recirculation of steam condensates as pro- cess water. the total volume of water recycled comes to more than 380 million cubic meters, meaning that the 57 million cubic meters of water originally deployed is used more than six times on average. water sourced in

conclude these cases with a positive effect for people and nature. in connection with the implementation of environmental protection measures and the mitigation of contamination, provisions are established for expected costs with regard to the remediation of contaminated sites, the recultivation of landfills, the clean-up of environmental pollution at ex- isting production or storage sites and similar measures. this ensures that we are able to implement necessary measures. we report on provisions in the 2020 annual report. 8.4 waste and recycling we want to minimize material consumption and disposal vol- umes through systematic waste management. waste sepa- ration, safe disposal channels and economically expedient recycling processes serve this purpose. in accordance with our corporate regulations, all production sites are obliged to prevent, recycle and reduce waste and to dispose of it safely and in line with good environmental practices. each of our sites must have an up-to-date waste register that in- cludes for each waste stream the name and description of the waste, its source and volume and sufficient information on its composition, hazard classification and final treatment and disposal. production fluctuations, building refurbishment and land re- mediation work influence waste volumes and recycling paths. sustainability report 2020 73 sustainability

2020 compared to 2019. this was mainly attributable to the seed production site in , argentina, where large amounts of waste composed of plant byproducts were disposed of as nonhazardous waste for agricultural use and composting. the volume of hazardous waste fell by 3.4% compared to 2019 due to the completion of construction and remediation work at the vapi site in india. waste generated ,000

providers/waste disposal companies) for disposal or utilization for energy generation or composting disposal, recycling and processing legislation prohibits the recycling and processing/treatment of a large proportion of our materials, especially pharmaceu- ticals and crop protection products. in our divisions, we make use of the opportunities for recycling within the frame- work of legal regulations. production-specific and sub- stance-specific recycling is carried out in compliance with the individual requirements of a given production site. pack- aging materials are recycled in line with national regulations material-based recycling is important in crop science's ac- tive ingredient and intermediate manufacture, and is handled individually at the respective production site. solvents, cata- lysts and intermediates are processed and returned to the production process. in global process development for ac- tive ingredients and intermediates, material recycling is con- sidered an important development criterion. processes are in place at to ensure the safe sell-off of products, including the disposal of obsolete inventories or waste. returns of obsolete stocks of crop protection prod- ucts are accepted in individual cases. the crop protection product industry has set up voluntary initiatives in various countries for the proper disposal of obsolete stocks. as part of its activities in the international croplife association, crop science is working with the food and agriculture organiza- tion (fao) of the united nations and the world bank to sup- port the proper collection and disposal of obsolete crop pro- tection products in africa. in the pharmaceuticals and consumer health divisions, pro- duction-specific recycling is carried out in compliance with the individual requirements of a given production site. the disposal of pharmaceutical products is subject to strict safety criteria, so no recycling is possible for the portfolios of the pharmaceuticals and consumer health divisions. mate- rial-based recycling takes place at the pharmaceuticals site in bergkamen, germany, in the form of the recovery of sol- vents used in production.

incident. factors that determine whether there is a reporting obligation for a particular environmental incident include, in particular, the nature and quantity of the substance, the amount of damage caused and any consequences for nearby residents. in accordance with our internal voluntary commitment, we report any leakage of substances with a high hazard potential from a quantity of 100

0.32 cases per 200,000 hours worked, corresponding to 383 occupa- tional injuries worldwide (2019: 600). the rir thus came in below the defined target for 2020 of 0.40. this means that, in statistical terms, one recordable incident occurred for more than every 630,000 hours worked. recordable injuries with lost workdays constituted 240 of the total of 383 occu- pational injuries, meaning that the corresponding parameter, the lost time recordable incident rate (ltrir), declined to 0.20 in 2020. the substantial reduction in occupational inju- ries compared with the previous year was due in part to in- creased working from home, which was considerably ex- panded as a protective measure in connection with the covid-19 pandemic. regrettably, two people lost their lives in work-related acci- dents in 2020. a employee died in a road accident af- ter a business appointment and another employee had a fa- tal accident while working in a field on a tractor. 8.6 occupational health and

not globally standardized - and in many countries do not exist at all - we document all occupational illnesses, provided they have been diagnosed and recog- nized by a physician. in 2020, 29 new cases of occupational illnesses were reported throughout the group, 12 of them with lost workdays. these were related to the muscu- loskeletal system and skin reactions, among other disorders, without a clear pattern of risk areas emerging. the number of incidents corresponds to 0.1 occupational illnesses per one million hours worked. rate of recordable occupational injuries (rir) by region1

addition to the appraisals by experts, both our employees and those of contracted companies are urged to immedi- ately report work-related hazards or dangerous situations to their supervisors or via the compliance hotline. reports via the hotline can also be made anonymously if permitted by respective national law. notification of accidents and injuries 2020 11% traffic & transport 5% contact with chemicals 13% other 47% mechanical work measures, therefore, promoting safety-conscious behavior is an important starting point for preventing accidents and inju- ries. the measures we take and initiatives we introduce take into account globally recognized occupational health and safety principles. employees are our top priority, the group crisis staff unit headed up by the chairman of the board of management implemented the existing pandemic plans at an early stage. this enabled the reduction of covid-19-related risks for employees at the workplace. we had registered only a very low infection rate by the end of 2020. on top of the country-specific regulations on mandatory ex- aminations, we offer our employees regular medical exami- nations - in some cases on a mandatory basis - in all coun- tries in which this is legally permissible. the focus here is on hazard-based, workplace-related examinations. 24% moving (slipping/tripping/falling) within the context of our occupational safety management, employees and those of contracted companies re- ceive extensive training in the prevention of accidents and safety incidents. the measures range from safety briefings to special training courses on the safe handling of chemical substances. overall, more than 24,600 employees com- pleted safety training measures conveying detailed  in 2020. in 2020, as in previous years, the number of injuries involv- ing contact with chemicals was small (5%) in relation to the total number of occupational injuries. after the global rollout of our behavioral safety initiative to promote safety-conscious behavior, its  were en- shrined in a corporate regulation in 2020. the initiative en- compasses training programs, information and organiza- tional procedures that enhance employees' awareness of their own safety-relevant behavior and that of other employ- ees. behavioral improvements have been achieved in areas in which the behavioral safety program has already been implemented, so that the recordable incident rate is ex- pected to decline across the group in the medium term. a significant proportion of the accidents and injuries suffered by our employees have behavior-linked causes. for exam- ple, accidents can occur when employees use smartphones while walking. alongside technical and organizational occupational health and safety during the covid-19 pandemic in 2020, occupational health and safety at was heavily impacted by the progression and development of the covid-19 pandemic. as the health and safety of our the globally implemented protection concepts and measures take into account the varying occupational tasks at the respective sites. we were able to maintain or quickly restart production at the sites and thus ensure the supply of products to our patients and customers. the following measures played a role here: // working from home wherever possible // \"stop entry\": no access for employees showing symp- toms of illness, safeguarded by a self-check question- naire and body temperature checks at the site gates and entrances // two-meter distancing rule; in areas in which it is not pos- sible to observe this distance, plastic dividers were in- stalled and the use of facemasks during working hours was mandated // hygiene rules for hand-washing and disinfection, and the general use of a facemask; we provided our employees with cloth masks at an early stage in all countries in which that was possible according to national law all rules, instructions, faqs and further information for em- ployees are being continuously updated and made available on a central intranet platform for the duration of the pan- demic. our employees are notified at all times of the current status of applicable local measures. sustainability report 2020 76 sustainability strategy 1. the company 2. corporate governance 3. product stewardship 4. procurement 5. human rights 6. employees 7. climate protection 8. environmental protection and safety 9. foundation activities 8.7 biosafety 8.7 biosafety in accordance with the guidelines of the world health or- ganization (who) on biorisk management principles, we consider biosafety to comprise the principles, technologies and processes implemented to prevent unintended expo- sure to biological materials that could pose a risk to people or the environment. misuse or theft of biological materials is also prevented by corresponding measures. biological material must be handled with suitable care to en- sure that employees, residents and the environment are pro- tected. this includes microorganisms, invertebrates, verte- brates, plants, cell cultures, genetically modified organisms, toxins and allergens. an assessment of the biosafety risk is necessary before biological materials can be used, particu- larly in r&d and production. these analyses are conducted by the employee responsible for biosafety in each case and verified together with an expert. all employees tasked with biosafety must undergo regular training. processes for carrying out assessments and measures are established in a corporate regulation on biosafety that is ori- ented to the specifications of the who. wherever local laws and regulations are more stringent than the standards laid out by the corporate regulation, the more stringent variant takes precedence. a group of biosafety experts from all divisions and regions cooperates within the biosafety panel. under the aus- pices of the corporate hse enabling function, the panel is responsible for developing, reviewing and implementing 's biosafety rules and regulations throughout the group. it also advises and supports the biosafety commu- nity with which it maintains regular communication to ensure a uniform and high standard of biosafety throughout the company. the implementation of legal and group guidelines on biosafety is also overseen by the hse audit program. 8.8 plant safety we aim to design and operate our processes and produc- tion facilities in such a way that they do not pose any inap- propriate risks to our employees, the environment or neigh- boring communities. this is conditional upon an effective system to ensure plant safety being in place that enables operational risks to be identified, remedied and reduced and their effects mitigated. we are continuously working to fur- ther develop the safety culture, the expertise of employees and the globally applicable corporate regulations on process and plant safety, which also cover topics such as machine and laboratory safety and prescribe uniform processes and standards for evaluating risks and establishing suitable safety measures. in this way we ensure that a uniform safety level is in place at the approximately 40 sites at which volumes of hazardous substances significant for plant safety are stored or processed, while satisfying at least the local le- gal requirements. we completed the integration of the sites of the acquired agricultural business into 's plant safety processes in the first quarter of 2020 and introduced the corporate regulations on process and plant safety. their implementation at the sites will involve appropriate training for employees. operators for conducting risk analysis and drawing up safety concepts. using systematic analytical methods, the process risks of our facilities are identified in interdisciplinary teams supervised by these experts. on this basis, the team devel- ops robust protective concepts that take into account health, safety and environmental aspects. everyone involved in this process completes a group-wide plant safety training program. in addition, the safety experts must undergo a globally valid internal training and certification program that qualifies them to carry out risk analyses in the teams. the certification program ensures compliance with globally uni- form quality standards in the development of safety con- cepts at our production facilities. ultimately, the corporate hse enabling function performs the necessary governance for process and plant safety in the group. this function further develops the group's safety management system and establishes the internal safety requirements, verifying their observance through spe- cial process and plant safety audits. to maintain the high safety level of our facilities, these safety concepts are reviewed every five years. technical modifica- tions are subject to a stringent change management pro- cess. furthermore, maintenance and inspection programs are established for the safety facilities to ensure the neces- sary availability and functionality in case of need. responsibilities and verification to ensure a high safety level at our facilities,

further development of plant safety to maintain and strengthen safety awareness, the globally binding training program topps (top performance in pro- cess and plant safety) is continuously updated and im- proved. participation is compulsory for all employees who are able to influence process and plant safety at pro- duction and auxiliary facilities and is documented in the training system. topps training documentation both for face-to-face training and web-based training is available in 15 languages. we are further developing plant safety, both within our com- pany and beyond this worldwide in the form of standards, in internal global and regional networks of experts and through our involvement in associations such as the european pro- cess safety centre (epsc), the center for chemical process safety (ccps), and the german chemical industry association (vci). since 2019, we have used the globally standardized key performance indicator (kpi) process safety incident rate (psi-r) as an early indicator for plant safety incidents. this is integrated into group-wide safety reporting. reporting of this indicator is based on the requirements of the interna- tional council of chemical associations (icca). process safety incidents (psis) refer to the unwanted leakage of chemical substances or energy in amounts above defined thresholds from their primary containment, such as pipe- lines, pumps, tanks or drums. the psi rate indicates the number of process safety incidents per 200,000 hours worked. in 2020, the psi-r was 0.08 (2019: 0.10). a total of 92 plant safety incidents occurred in 2020 (process safety incident count, psi-c). in addition, we are also indicating the process safety inci- dent severity rate (psi-sr) for the first time in 2020. we re- port this according to the grading system of the international council of chemical associations (icca). process safety incidents1 process safety incident count (psi-c)1 process safety incident rate (psi-r)1,2 process

communi- cated to potentially affected sites throughout the group. the reporting thresholds are intentionally set at such a low level that even material and energy leaks that have no impact on employees, the local community or the environ- ment are systematically recorded and reported. we pursue this preventive approach so that weaknesses can be identi- fied and corrected before a more serious incident can occur. 8.9 transportation and storage safety logistics at comprises not just the transportation and warehousing of goods, but also the steering and monitoring of flows of goods and logistics data for the group. transportation and storage safety is part of the hse management system and is implemented by a network of experts and users with practical experience who cooperate across the group. in this case, safety means having procedures in place that en- sure that materials are handled, transported and stored ac- cording to the relevant regulations and their respective hazard potential and that suitable logistics and warehouse suppliers are selected. details are specified in the transportation safety, warehousing and health, safety and environment au- dits corporate regulations. the underlying standards comprise not just internal guidelines, but also the rules of the in- ternational crop protection association croplife international and the european guidelines on good distribution practice of medicinal products for human use. 's corporate di- rective on storage safety (warehousing) applies equally to in- ternal warehouses and external warehouse sites and facilities. transportation safety plays a key role both in the transporta- tion of our products on public routes and in loading, unload- ing, classification, labeling and packaging, particularly of hazardous goods. we use both internal capacities and ex- ternal logistics partners for storage and transport services. our procurement unit selects logistics partners according to strict safety, environmental and quality criteria, as described in the safety and quality assessment system (sqas) of the european chemical industry council (cefic). sustainability report 2020 78 sustainability strategy 1. the company 2. corporate governance 3. product stewardship

and crisis management processing of such incidents is primarily the responsibility of the local safety and crisis organization or the local emer- gency response team. for this purpose, organizational pre- cautions with defined responsibilities and procedures have been implemented at the sites and in the countries. the re- sponsible persons have been correspondingly trained. de- pending on how the situation develops, we involve business partners and the local community around the sites, such as city authorities or neighboring companies. depending on the extent of damage, the group crisis staff unit as an over- arching body assumes the further coordination and steering of crisis management and the restoration of operations. for example, the group crisis staff unit headed up by the chairman of the board of management was activated in con- nection with the covid-19 pandemic. it defines the strategic direction of crisis management and is supported by special- ized task forces. in addition, the local crisis staff units con- vened in the country organizations according to the crisis re- action plans and took the necessary steps in accordance with the global stipulations and local laws. our highest priori- ties are the protection and safety of our employees and the provision of our patients and customers with our products. crisis management is supported by the established business continuity management system, which is based on the 22301 standard. business continuity plans contain predefined reaction options for the loss of personnel or downtime of buildings, machinery, it systems or suppliers. the plans cover various emergency scenarios, such as a longer-term regional blackout or climate-change-related impacts on production sites. the management system comprises suitable it measures such as ensuring service performance or rapid res- toration following a disruptive event. the plans are regularly updated and communicated through training measures. by activating business continuity plans, the resilience of our busi- ness activities was ensured during the covid-19 pandemic. as part of its enterprise risk management, for example, also regularly analyzes safety risks and implements suitable identification, prevention and processing measures, including employee training and information measures per- taining to cyber security, for example. safety and crisis sim- ulation exercises are also regularly conducted at site and group levels. the number of employees and partners in- volved depends on the type of exercise. we test the restora- tion of it systems and data for one of our global data cen- ters each year at a different site together with our it service providers. utilizing digital technologies, we work continually to develop logistics strategies that take account of safety, environmen- tal and cost aspects. areas of environmental focus include the reduction of co2 emissions, for example by minimizing air transport or using logistics strategies that include rail- ways and waterways. 8.10 emergency and crisis management we ensure safe working conditions and an environment where our employees can work safely and without fear and undertake international business travel without risk. in emer- gency and crisis situations, ensuring the safety of our em- ployees, facilities and sites is our top priority. through corporate regulations on emergency planning, emergency response, safety and crisis management, as well as pandemic planning, has taken action at the global and local levels to prepare the organization for extraordinary events (e.g. major damage events or crimes), and assess and process them according to uniform criteria. subse- quently, improvement potential is determined if necessary and integrated into existing concepts. extraordinary events are registered in the emergency response system according to a standard group-wide procedure and re- ported to the global security operation center, which initi- ates the further steps such as the effective steering of infor- mation. this enables us to identify risks facing the company at an early stage and introduce mitigating steps if necessary or provide assistance once incidents have already material- ized. sustainability report 2020 80 sustainability strategy 1. the company 2. corporate governance 3. product stewardship 4. procurement 5.

foundations' activities all reflect our multifaceted approach to combating the pandemic and promoting social aid pro- jects. to this end, we established five focal points that are particularly aimed at providing support for patients and nurs- ing and medical personnel: the provision of products and the use of our facilities and production sites, the enhance- ment of our employees' competencies and the allocation of financial resources as well as the close cooperation with our partners and within our networks. at the international level, we distributed two million products from our self-care portfolio as well as several thousand units of prescription medication to ngos and disaster manage- ment teams all over the world. we transformed two of 's production sites at short notice into facilities able to manufacture more than 150,000 liters of hand sanitizer. this was distributed to medical facilities and other public institu- tions free of charge. furthermore, we converted a research laboratory in berlin at an early stage into a covid- 19 test to allow for the testing of particularly vulnerable personnel groups such as caregivers from the medical sec- tor or police and firefighters. around 100,000 tests had been conducted in our test laboratory by the end of 2020. furthermore, we supplied over 600,000 items of protective equipment, executed more than six information campaigns aimed at particularly vulnerable segments of society, actively provided psychological support for medical personnel, sup- plied more than 20 clinical trials with products and joined various research consortia. in addition, the cares foundation provided around EUR410,000 as immediate relief for combating the covid-19 pandemic in sub-saharan africa. this aid was used, among other things, to install a mobile messaging service in mali in cooperation with the london school of hygiene and tropi- cal medicine to provide the population with information about the virus and appropriate hygiene measures. , support was provided for implementing an operational plan for responding to the crisis on behalf of the kenyan nongovernmental organization access afya, which operates a network of health stations and pharmacies in nairobi's poorer districts. in total, we have provided over EUR29 million in product, mate- rial and monetary donations in more than 60 countries to fight the covid-19 pandemic. social innovation beyond our activities in connection with the covid-19 pan- demic, we also continued to provide aid through the social innovation ecosystem fund. the endowment from this eco- system fund established by the cares foundation in 2019 is used to support technological and social entrepre- neurial solutions in health care and agriculture. the focus thereby is on promoting projects that empower sub-saharan african smallholder farmers to lift themselves and their fami- lies out of poverty with their small farms through improved access to medical care. one emphasis is on supporting women. as part of this fund, the cares foundation supported five major, primarily public service-oriented companies and nongovernmental organizations in the focus areas in 2020. these are working on expanding innovative nutrition and health programs in senegal, mali and uganda and include, for example, the nongovernmental organization living goods, the goal of which is to save lives in local communi- ties with the help of health workers, who are supported with digital tools. living goods works with governments and partners and uses smart mobile technologies to implement innovative and at the same time cost-effective approaches that have a significant impact on health care. the nongov- ernmental organization path receives money from the fund that is used to assist 50,000 households in southern sene- gal in combating malaria. these households comprise around 250,000 people. sustainability report 2020 82 sustainability strategy 1. the company 2. corporate

communities as part of the international volunteering program, the u.s.-based fund supports projects by employees who want to help improve living conditions near our sites. through programs established by our science & edu- cation foundation, we also promote scientific learning at schools in the communities close to our sites around the world. science and education we regard pioneering achievements in science and society as a basic condition for progress and success. promoting leading-edge research and supporting education and talent are therefore central matters for the science & educa- tion foundation. in this way, we want to attract a flow of new employees over the long term and promote acceptance of technology within society as a whole. with the science & education foundation's , we honor innovations in life sciences that are of great importance for scientific progress and could poten- tially contribute to the development of innovative products or new technologies in medicine and agriculture. in 2020, one of the leading scientists in the field of microbiome re- search was awarded our renowned research prize. further- more, our early excellence in science award honors young scientists who have achieved outstanding research results already at the beginning of their career. a total of four prizes were awarded in 2020 for outstanding research achievements in the fields of electron microscopy, or chemical synthe- sis, alzheimer's research and machine learning approaches for the preparation of biomedical data. in partnership with the , we support doctoral students in a postdoctoral program. the focus of this pro- gram in the coming years will be on promoting talented young scientists from africa. has created various programs to support young scientists at the earliest possible stage. through the fellowship program, we enable students and apprentices from scientific and medical disciplines to participate in train- ing and research projects in germany and abroad. we were unable to carry out this international exchange program in 2020 due to the covid-19 pandemic. we engage young school students with the program of the science & education foundation, which supports teachers in designing curricula in the scientific disciplines. the goal is to awaken interest in the subjects of mathe- matics, information technology, science and technology through innovative projects and unique insights. in 2020, 18 projects in these disciplines received funding through the program. sustainability report 2020 83 further information independent auditor's report independent auditor's report on a limited assurance engagement concerning sustainability information to aktiengesellschaft, leverkusen, germany engagement as requested, we have performed a limited assurance en- gagement on the information contained in the sustainability report 2020 of aktiengesellschaft, leverkusen, ger- many, for the period from january 1 to december 31, 2020 (hereafter referred to as \"sustainability report\"). our engagement does not include links to the annual report and web pages of the group, interviews and personal statements. responsibilities of the executive directors the executive directors of aktiengesellschaft are re- sponsible for the preparation of the sustainability report in accordance with the principles stated in the sustainability reporting standards of the global reporting initiative provided in the \"core\" option (hereafter referred to as \"gri standards\"). these responsibilities of the executive directors of the company include the selection and application of appropri- ate methods for sustainability reporting and the use of as- sumptions and estimates for individual disclosures which are reasonable under the given circumstances. in addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of a sustainability report that is free from mate- rial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. the accuracy and completeness of environmental data in the sustainability report is subject to inherent boundaries, which result from the nature and type of data collection, data aggregation and respective necessary assumptions. responsibilities of the independent practitioner our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the infor- mation of the sustainability report stated above based on our work performed within our limited assurance en- gagement. we are independent of aktiengesellschaft in ance with the requirements of german commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. our audit firm applies the german national legal require- ments and the german professional pronouncements on quality control, in particular the professional charter for german public auditors and german sworn auditors (berufssatzung fur vereidigte buch- prufer) as well as the quality assurance standard: quality assurance requirements in audit practices (idw qs 1) promulgated by the institut der wirtschaftsprufer (idw), which comply with the international standard on quality control 1 (isqc 1) issued by the international auditing and assurance standards board (iaasb). we conducted our work in accordance with the international standard on assurance engagements 3000 (revised): assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information (isae 3000 (revised)), issued by the iaasb. this standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance and engagement so that we can conclude with limited assurance that no matters have come to our attention to cause us to believe that the information contained in the sustainability report of aktiengesell- schaft for the period from january 1 to december 31, 2020 has not been prepared, in all material respects, in ance with the gri standards. the procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement; consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained, had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. the choice of assurance work is subject to the practitioner's professional judgment. within the scope of our limited assurance engagement, which we performed between october 2020 and february 2021, we notably performed the following procedures and activities: sustainability report 2020 84 // gaining an understanding of the structure of the sustainability organization and of the stakeholder engagement // a remote site audit for bergkamen,

consolidated financial statements, the annual financial statements and the combined management report // assessment of the presentation of the information practitioner's conclusion based on the work performed and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the information contained in the sustainability report 2020 of aktiengesellschaft for the period from january 1 to december 31, 2020 has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the gri stand- ards provided in the \"core\" option. our conclusion does not include links to web pages of the group, interviews and personal statements. purpose of the assurance report we issue this report as stipulated in the engagement letter agreed with aktiengesellschaft. the limited assurance engagement has been performed for the purposes of aktiengesellschaft and the report is solely intended to inform aktiengesellschaft about the result of the assurance engagement. liability

sustainability report 2020 94 glossary a e h additionality compensation projects aimed at reducing greenhouse gases must ensure that their reduction, prevention or storage of emissions occurs additionally. this means that the project's climate protection measure would not have occurred without the expected revenue from the sale of emissions certificates. the technical term for this is the additionality of emissions reductions. furthermore, the emissions reduction measure must be conducted on an ongoing basis. b biocides are substances and products that control pests such as insects, mice and rats, as well as algae, fungi and bacteria. (bacillus thuringiensis) is a bacterium that can be found primarily in soil, as well as on plants and in insect cadavers. the toxins produced by the bacterium are used for biological pest control in agriculture and forestry, as well as to control disease-transmitting mosquitoes. c corruption perceptions index (cpi) is the world's most renowned corruption indicator. it is compiled by the international secretariat of the ngo transparency international and has listed countries according to their perceived levels of public sector cor- ruption since 1995. the cpi comprises 180 countries. crispr-cas is a new molecular-biological method of specifically modifying genetic material. it enables individ- ual dna building blocks to be inserted, removed or modified. this process basically works with all organ- isms. it is used in animal and plant breeding, and in biotechnology. ecosystem fund the term \"ecosystem fund\" refers to a sum of grants or other funding opportunities created for organizations that address key global societal challenges. this includes incentivizing participation in expanding and shaping an ecosystem through cross-sector and multi-stakeholder collaboration, in order to enhance the positive impact of the provided funds, such as the foundation's social innovation ecosystem fund. ecosystem services are the benefits people obtain from ecosystems. ecosystem services upon which crop production depends include, for instance, soil fertility, soil erosion prevention, nutrient cycling, soil or matter provision, pest control, water regulation and pollination. g ghg (greenhouse gas) protocol the greenhouse gas protocol is an internationally recognized tool for recording, quantifying and reporting greenhouse gas emissions. its standards cover all emissions within a company's value chain. aligns itself to the corporate standard for direct (scope 1) and indirect (scope 2) greenhouse gas emissions and also to the corporate value chain accounting and reporting standard (scope 3), which covers further indirect emissions along the value chain. dual reporting was introduced for indirect (scope 2) emissions. indirect emissions have to be reported using both the location- based and the market-based methods. the location- based method uses regional or national average emissions factors, while the market-based method applies provider- or product-specific emissions factors based on contractual instruments. herbicide-tolerant plants are resistant to the mecha- nism of action of a herbicide. l lmics (low- and middle-income countries) according to the world bank, these include low- and middle-income economies (low/lower middle/upper middle) with a gni per capita maximum income ranging from us$1,036 /4,035/ to us$12,535 (based on 2019 figures, calculated according to the world bank atlas method). r 3rs principle in animal welfare (replace, reduce, re- fine) replace: prior to each project, checks whether an approved method is available that does not rely on animal studies and then applies it. reduce: in case no alternative method exists, only as many animals are used as are needed to achieve scientifically meaningful results based on statutory requirements. refine: ensures that animal studies are performed in a way that minimizes any suffering to the animals. s significant locations of operation a selection of countries that accounted for more than 80% of total group sales in 2020 (argentina, australia, belgium, brazil, canada, china, france, germany, india, italy, japan, mexico, russia, spain, switzerland, the united kingdom and the united states). further information glossary sustainability report 2020 95 masthead published by ag, 51368 leverkusen, germany date of publication thursday, february 25, 2021 editor , phone   affairs & sustainability , phone   phone   the internet: forward-looking statements: this publication may contain forward-looking statements based on current assumptions and forecasts made by management. various known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors could lead to material differences between the actual future results, financial situation, development or performance of the company and the estimates given here. these factors include those discussed in 's public reports which are available on the website at the company assumes no liability whatsoever to update these forward-looking statements or to conform them to future events or de velopments. legal notice: the product names designated with (tm) are brands of the group or our distribution partners and are registered trademarks in many countries.\n"

integral part of the bmw group's corporate identity and continue to form the basis for our economic success. we strive constantly to meet the high expectations our customers have in our products. our business model is intrinsically linked with the principle of sustainability and we see the two factors as an integral unit. we aspire to be not only the most successful, but also the most sustainable premium provider of individual mobility and always focus on the needs of our customers. the bmw group's stance is unwavering: ecological and social sustainability, responsibility for our products and a clear commitment to conserving resources are at the heart of our corporate strategy. we think and manage our corporate affairs in a holistic manner. for instance, we do not limit our understanding of environmental sus- tainability to the emissions generated by our ves, but rather take the entire value chain into account - whether along the supply chain, in our production processes, dur- ing the use phase or at the end-of-life recycling stage. we have firmly embedded the principle of sustainability in every aspect of our business. our primary aim is to balance the interests of economy, ecology and society and thereby contribute to ecological and societal improve- ment. global challenges such as growing urbanisation and the finite nature of natural resources have inspired and motivated us to develop a range of innovative products and services. climate change is one of the greatest chal- lenges of our time and we are fully committed to the paris climate agreement in order to mitigate its effects. as the bmw group, we are making our contribution by focusing on developing and improving technologies and services that can effectively help bring about a via- ble reduction in the global carbon emissions caused by individual mobility. with this strategy we can create a clear competitive advantage by offering our customers emotional, trendsetting mobility solutions that are also made with sustainable principles in mind. our actions as a company have a positive impact on the economy and society. we are a company operating on a global scale. as such, we acknowledge our responsibility to contribute to economic prosperity in the countries where we are located. for this reason, we not only aspire to achieve sustained profitable growth for the group, but also to make a specific contribution towards economic devel- opment and improvement in the quality of life at the locations where we operate. the growth of the bmw group not only provides a reasonable return for investors, but also attractive salaries for its employees. we also make a positive contribution to society in general at the locations where we operate, firstly by paying the amounts due to public authorities (such as customs duties and taxes) and secondly in the form of social, cultural and corporate citizenship activi- ties. corporate citizenship. bmw group combined management report report

bmw group consolidated its position as one of the world's most attractive employers. its leading role in terms of sustainability also contributes to employee loyalty within the bmw group. the bmw group comprises bmw ag itself and all subsidiaries over which bmw ag has either direct or in- direct control. bmw ag is also responsible for managing the group, which is sub-divided into the automotive, motorcycles and financial services operating segments. the other entities segment primarily comprises holding companies and group financing companies. the transformation of mobility and the advance of digitalisation are opportunities. organisation and business model mobility patterns worldwide, and hence the entire automotive industry, are currently undergoing profound change. we see this transformation as an opportunity to set new industry standards and innovate in the fields of electrification, connectivity and automated driving. digitalisation provides us with an excellent oppor- tunity to take a fundamentally new approach to devel- oping products for the benefit of our customers. we not only react to customer wishes, but also anticipate them through a good understanding of their preferences. moreover, digitalisation enables us to redesign processes throughout the entire organisation. we are moving forward in our own independent way. as societal values as well as demographic and tech- nological conditions change, new demands on mobility solutions are constantly emerging. the ambition to fulfil those wishes and needs is the force that drives us for- ward. we are taking steps to ensure a viable future for our business by developing innovatively, sustainably and independently. general information on the bmw group is provid- ed below. there have been no significant changes in the group's structure compared to the previous year. bayerische motoren werke aktiengesellschaft (bmw ag), based in munich, germany, is the parent company of the bmw group. the starting point for the bmw group's corporate strategy is to act in a consistent manner on a custom- er-oriented and sustainable basis. products, brands and services are currently being

automotive, motorcycles and financial services operating segments. automotive segment the bmw brand caters to a wide variety of customer requirements. its model portfolio comprises an extensive range of automobiles, including the premium compact class, the premium mid-size luxury class and the ul- tra-luxury class. apart from fully electric models such as the bmw ix3*, which was launched in 2020, it also includes state-of-the-art plug-in hybrids and conventional models powered by highly efficient combustion engines. together with the highly successful models of the bmw x family and the high-performance bmw m brand, the bmw group meets the diverse expectations and needs of its customers worldwide. the mini brand promises driving pleasure in the premium small car segment and, apart from models pow- ered by efficient combustion engines, also offers plug- in hybrid and fully electric variants. rolls-royce is the ultimate marque in the ultra-luxury segment, boasting a tradition that stretches back over more than 100 years. rolls-royce motor cars specialises in bespoke customer specifications and offers the very highest level of quality and service. the global sales network of the bmw group's automo- bile business currently comprises more than 3,500 bmw, over 1,600 mini and some 140 rolls-royce dealerships. motorcycles segment the motorcycles business is also clearly focused on the premium segment. the model range currently comprises motorcycles in the sport, tour, roadster, heritage, adventure and urban mobility categories. bmw motor rad also offers a broad range of equipment options to enhance rider safety and comfort. the mo- torcycles business sales network is organised similarly to that of the automobiles business. currently, bmw motorcycles are sold by more than 1,200 dealerships and importers in over 90 countries. financial services segment the bmw group is a leading provider of financial services in the automotive sector. it offers these services in around 60 countries worldwide via companies and cooperation arrangements with local financial services providers and importers. the financial services seg- ment's main business is credit financing and the leasing of bmw group brand automobiles and motorcycles to retail customers. customers can also choose from an attractive array of insurance and banking products. operating under the brand name , the bmw group's international multi-brand fleet business provides financing and comprehensive management ser- vices for corporate car fleets in more than 20 countries. these services also include helping customers to manage their fleets on a sustainable and climate-friendly basis. financing dealership ve fleets serves to support the dealership organisation and rounds off the segment's range of services. products and services * see fuel consumption and co2 emissions information. bmw group combined management report report 2020 (cid:42)eneral information and (cid:42)roup (cid:51)rofile strategy, goals and management system strategic orientation of the bmw group individual mobility, as the bmw group understands it, is inextricably linked with conserving the world's nat- ural resources. the bmw group bases its contribution to the sustainable development of our planet on scien- tifically derived criteria. with this principle in mind, it combines ecological and social aspects with securing its long-term future in all its activities. the bmw group views the combination of driving pleasure and respon- sibility for acting sustainably as a clear factor for dif- ferentiation. the outcome is that customers experience outstanding innovative products made by a company focused on sustainability. however, that is merely the starting point for the bmw group, which intends to integrate sustainability more strongly than ever in its corporate strategy. the strategy establishes the necessary conditions to fulfill both customer expectations and regulatory requirements regarding emissions in the group's various markets by offering a wide range of products. its clear ambition is to ensure that all areas of the company think, manage and demonstrably act in a true spirit of sustainability. this way of thinking has resulted in the bmw group reaching the logical strategic decision to move away from pursuing a separate sustainability strategy and present- ing a separate sustainable value report. sustainability is 41 the basic pattern that shapes the bmw group's strategy. from beginning to end, activities and plans should com- prehensively be examined with regard to their economic, ecological and social impacts and the corresponding decisions taken based on an integrated approach. with effect from the financial year 2020, the group is there- fore integrating its reporting. a group report of this nature covers a variety of key aspects and endeavours to highlight correlations in a transparent manner. the bmw group is therefore consciously subjecting all of its activities to a comprehensive external audit, including its activities in the area of sustainability. the strategy arrow - pointing the way to the future the bmw group's strategy comprises four key ele- ments, which are summarised in a strategy arrow that points towards the future. position - what does the bmw group stand for? the bmw group stands for first-class individual mobility and sustained responsibility. these factors pro- vide transparency and reliability for shareholders and investors as well as for partners in the supply chain and the production and sales system, but also for all other stakeholders, political decision makers, the media and the general public. the bmw group considers itself as a pioneer and sets standards for the individual mobility of tomorrow. it combines joy and responsibility without compromise and, together with its partners, leads the industry in terms of environmental, social and integrity standards. the bmw group is committed to complying with the paris climate agreement - with a verifiable track record of continuous improvement. it is promoting the principles of circular economy, both in its corporate philosophy and in close collaboration with its partners - from the supply chain to production, the use phase and the recycling of its products. position direction strategic approach collaboration bmw group combined management report report 2020 (cid:42)eneral information and (cid:42)roup (cid:51)rofile 42 direction - what is the bmw group's driving force? its aspiration to manufacture products that will in- spire its customers - both today and in the future. that is the force that drives the bmw group. at the same time, the group strives to achieve a high level of profitability in order to safeguard its corporate independence and distinctively shape the mobility trends of the future. the integration of ecological and social aspects throughout its entire value chain ensures the continued viability of the bmw group going forward. the group is built on a firm foundation of strong brands and emotional products. in the face of increasing- ly fierce competition, the bmw group continues to hone its brand profiles and express them, among other ways, in a unique, characteristic automotive design language. design arouses emotions and emotion drives desire. at the bmw group, outstanding design always follows function. the kidney-shaped grille of the new bmw ix, for example, takes on a new role as a smart surface that not only conceals new technologies, but has the ability to self-heal due to the use of innovative materials, so that slight scratches disappear by themselves. innovation and customer orientation the products must deliver what their design prom- ises, sportiness, quality and emotionality, a fact that applies equally to all drivetrain technologies. the bmw group is a leading supplier of electrified ves, the foundation for which was laid at an early stage by project i with the all-electric bmw i3 in 2013. mean- while, the group is in the middle of its second phase: in order to keep pace with growing market demand, it is expanding its offering of electric drivetrains across all segments. with its flexible platforms and the fifth gen- eration of in-house developed fully electric drive trains, the bmw group can offer its customers worldwide a broad and mature range of products. for example, the all-electric mini cooper se * and the bmw ix3 * were both launched in the course of 2020 and will be followed by the bmw i4 and the bmw ix * in 2021. in future, models such as the high-volume bmw 5 se- ries and the x1 as well as the bmw 7 series will be available with four different types of drivetrain - all-electric, plug-in hybrid, petrol and diesel. moreover, the bmw group is preparing for the third phase of its transformation with a new ve architecture starting in the mid-2020s. over the next ten years, the group intends to have more than seven million of its electrified ves on roads world- wide - at least two-thirds of them all-electric models. with this aim in mind, the bmw group is system- atically expanding its product range and progressively enhancing both its technologies and its ve archi- tectures, the latest of which are entirely centred on fully electric drivetrain systems. at the same time, the group is taking another major step in terms of digitalised con- nectivity, not only within the ve itself, but also in its corporate processes. as part of its performance programme, the bmw group is also working to continuously raise its level of efficiency in order to compensate for the high upfront expenditures required for the technologies that will shape the world of tomorrow. profitability and free cash flow have a high priority within the bmw group's corporate management system. all the measures and initiatives it takes are therefore aimed at continually developing its strong economic base. * see fuel consumption and co2 emissions information. bmw group combined management report report 2020 (cid:42)eneral information and (cid:42)roup (cid:51)rofile 43 moreover, to express the importance of its ability to perform in economic terms, the bmw group has set it- self ambitious financial targets in the course of realigning its strategy. in future, the key performance indicators (kpis) already used in the annual outlook, namely 1. profit before financial result as a percentage of auto- motive segment revenues (ebit margin automotive segment) and 2. return on capital employed for the automotive seg- ment ( automotive segment) will also be integrated as kpis at the strategic level. the aim is for the automotive segment's ebit margin to rise steadily again to between 8 % and 10 % and for the to reach a level of at least 40 % in the future. the two segment-related profitability indicators will be supplemented by the kpi 3. group profit before tax as a percentage of group revenues (bmw group ebt margin). with this strategy, the bmw group intends to gen- erate a group ebt margin in excess of 10 %. in terms of kpis, the equivalent to group ebt margin for corporate management purposes is group profit before tax (ebt). management system and outlook with regard to free cash flow, the bmw group focus- es particularly on capital expenditure and the systematic management of working capital. strategic approach - where is the bmw group heading? even faster digitalised processes and lean struc- tures are key prerequisites for consistently leveraging efficiencies. during the coronavirus pandemic year 2020, for example, advances in digitalisation enabled the bmw group to maintain direct contact with its cus- tomers, despite lockdowns worldwide. digitalisation is helping to shorten the process of developing new ve models by up to one-third. when the bmw group transi- tions to the more advanced smart ve architectures in 2021, the conventional drivetrain variants will be largely phased out to make way for electrified drivetrains such as mild hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully electric systems. these results will already begin to take effect from 2022. moreover, as one of its efficiency initiatives, the group regularly assesses how complexity can be rea- sonably reduced. complexity arises due to increasingly strict and globally heterogeneous regulatory require- ments. the group-wide performance programme also includes making the most of synergies and efficiencies in indirect purchasing as well as in terms of materials and production costs. and it goes without saying that the bmw group is selectively bolstering its performance with attractive new models - especially in segments gen- erating the highest returns. the bmw group places the strategic emphasis on its customers and their varying requirements worldwide. in the bmw group, trendsetting technologies, emotional products and individualised customer service merge to create a unique overall experience for customers. its strategy is therefore of a dynamic nature. on the one hand, the group's market environment is charac- terised by stable trends. this includes people's need for individual mobility, which the bmw group is convinced will remain strong and grow further in the years to come. on the other hand, however, it needs to be able to re- spond to uncertain developments both flexibly and with a sense of proportion. these developments can be of a (geo)political nature, but also come in the form of fully unexpected events such as the coronavirus pandemic. in 2020, the board of management realigned the core elements of the bmw group's strategy and focused them on the key technology areas that are expected to shape the future. innovative technologies are the key to the future of mobility going forward. by 2025, the bmw group intends to invest more than EUR 30 billion in research and development to reinforce its role as a leader of innovation. the group's plans are also an expression of confidence in terms of the way it sees business de- veloping going forward. its ability to integrate a broad variety of technologies in an overall system is of crucial importance. companies that succeed in mastering and combining both hardware and software in equal measure are those which will shape the future of the automobile in the long term. bmw group combined management report report 2020 (cid:42)eneral information and (cid:42)roup (cid:51)rofile 44 how does the bmw group ensure cooperation? sustainability placed at core of corporate strategy to achieve its strategic goals, the entire team of some 121,000 employees worldwide needs to work in a spirit of cooperation to implement the strategy, based on the principles of responsibility, appreciation, transparency, trust and openness. the bmw group therefore works hand in glove with both internal and external partners with the twin aims of achieving maximum effectiveness and joint success. the group needs to tackle the entrepreneurial, eco logical and social challenges in equal measure to accomplish these aims. decisions need to be analysed with regard to their interactions and consequences in the overall context. success is not something to be simply taken for granted, but has to be worked for every day anew. everyone needs to work hard for \"their\" company and deliver maximum performance in order to reach the common goal. success in corporate terms is always the joint success of all bmw group employees together with their partners. for this reason, it is also a key aspiration of the bmw group to be an attractive employer. sustainability is intrinsic to the bmw group's stra- tegic orientation. at the end of july 2020, the board of management of bmw ag announced the first details of this strategy and presented targets to which the enter- prise will remain committed for the period up to 2030. in this endeavour, the bmw group is building on a solid foundation. in recent years and decades, it has also re- peatedly set standards in sustainability that are acknowl- edged by external, independent bodies. in 2020, for example, the bmw group took back industry leadership in the automotive sector in the dow jones sustainability indices world and europe. the bmw group therefore occupies the top spot among automotive manufacturers dialogue with stakeholders. it is also in the top cdp grouping for its transparent disclosure of carbon emissions. the principle of continuous improvement has always been a key aspect of the bmw group's strategy. the group has therefore given a commitment to achieve climate neutrality across the entire value chain by no later than 2050. in view of the long-term nature of its targets and the fact that, from today's perspective, the technological and economic route remains uncertain, the bmw group sets its targets one decade at a time. in 2020, for example, the group set itself specific goals for the year 2030 based on scientific information. new science-based targets have emerged from the initiative of the same name (sbti). these targets are fully in line with the requirements of the paris climate agreement and put the bmw group on the path towards climate neutrality. carbon emissions are to be reduced by at least one-third per ve over the entire life cycle, from the supply chain to production to the end-of-life phase. the bmw group expects environmental and social stand- ards to be upheld by all participants in the supply chain, including those delivering critical raw materials. the bmw group aims to ensure the most sustainable supply chain in the industry. bmw group combined management report report 2020 (cid:42)eneral information and (cid:42)roup (cid:51)rofile 45 new and ambitious target framework by 2030 the corresponding key non-financial performance the bmw group is firmly convinced that the fight against climate change and the responsible use of re- sources will determine the future of our society - and thus also that of the bmw group. particularly as a premium manufacturer, the bmw group aspires to lead the way in promoting sustainability and is therefore also taking responsibility with regard to this key topic. this also means facing up to the challenges of the future, but also making effective use of opportunities as they arise. with this in mind, the bmw group focuses on the performance and diversity of its workforce, whereby the proportion of women in management positions at bmw group is seen as a key performance indicator for the future. moreover, the bmw group is rigorously going one step further by setting itself new and ambitious sustain- ability targets for 2030. they are an inherent aspect of strategic management and include the upstream supply chain, the group's own manufacturing operations as well as the customers' use phase. indicators are: 1. co2 emissions per ve produced 2. co2 emissions of the new ve fleet * 3. proportion of electrified ves in total deliveries in future, the key non-financial performance indica- tors will be supplemented to include co2 emissions gen- erated in the supply chain. the corresponding strategic focus is firmly established in every area of the company. * eu including norway and iceland. the new target framework represents a systematic continuation of the ten strategic sustainability goals already announced in 2012, which have been rigorously pursued in the period from 2012 to 2020. these sustain- ability goals were divided into three main fields of action: 1. products and services the increasing electrification of the bmw group's fleet and the systematic further development of combustion engines made it possible to remain within the fleet co2 limit set by the eu in the 2020 reporting period, taking all regulatory requirements and regulations into account. as a result, the group also achieved the target it set itself in 2012 of halving the carbon emissions generated by its european new ve fleet in the period from 1995 to 2020. carbon emissions and pollutants 2. production and value creation since 2020, the bmw group has obtained all of its

group's to- tal workforce during the year under report (bmw ag: 15.9 %) and therefore above the target range of 15 % to 17 % set for 2020. at 17.8 %, the proportion of women in management positions at bmw group (bmw ag: 16.2 %) was also within the target range at the end of 2020. the high proportion of women in junior management programmes also forms the basis for a further increase in the number of women in management positions over time. employee diversity bmw group combined management report report 2020 (cid:42)eneral information and (cid:42)roup (cid:51)rofile 46 strategic targets 2020

(cid:42)roup (cid:51)rofile 47 carbon targets for the vehicle's use phase by 2030, the carbon emissions generated by bmw group ves are to be reduced by more than 40 % per kilometre driven. the bmw group has been working successfully for many years to reduce the level of carbon emissions of its new ve fleet worldwide. as well as complying with its legal obligations, the group has always remained true to its voluntary commitments. the early deployment of efficient dynamics technologies since 2007 and the ongoing electrification of its ve fleet form the dual basis for continued compliance with statutory carbon emissions and fuel consumption limits going forward. as a pioneer of electric mobility, the bmw group is in the process of significantly expanding its range. by the end of 2021, it aims to have over one million ve- s powered by either all-electric or plug-in hybrid drivetrains on the road. bmw group customers will then be able to choose from a range of five fully electric series-produced models. the bmw group intends to have 25 electrified mod- els on the road by 2023. the plan is based on flexible ve architectures and production systems that enable a model to be manufactured as an all-electric version, as a plug-in hybrid or powered by a conventional internal combustion engine. this approach gives the bmw group the flexibility to take account of changes in market de- mand as well as differences in regulatory requirements and infrastructure in the various markets in which it operates. the bmw group forecasts that demand for its electrified ves is set to double by 2021 compared to 2019. according to the bmw group's forecasts, by 2021 the sale of electrified ves is expected to double compared to 2019 figures. by 2025, the proportion of electrified cars in total group deliveries is expected to rise to at least 25 %. however, group decarbonisation targets are far more ambitious. by 2030, it aims to reduce carbon emissions per kilometre driven during a given ve's use phase by more than 40 % compared to 2019 (scope 3 downstream). carbon emissions and pollutants the target is within the range defined by the sbti's calcu- lations to limit global warming to between 1.5 and 1.75 degrees celsius. carbon emissions in production and at business locations by 80 % the bmw group has a direct influence on the carbon emissions generated at its own plants and locations and has therefore been a leader in terms of resource efficiency in this field for many years. its underlying aspiration is even more ambitious than the international pursuing efforts of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees celsius. despite having already reduced the level of carbon emissions per ve produced by more than 70 % since 2006, the bmw group intends to

example of the measures taken, the group has already entered into contractual agreements with its cell manufacturers that only green electricity will be used to produce the fifth generation of battery cells, a move that should lead to a total saving of around ten mil- lion tonnes of carbon dioxide over the next ten years. moreover, the bmw group is currently in the process of creating the organisational conditions that enable it to reliably record and document the size of the carbon footprint generated via its supply chain. this, in turn, is the key prerequisite for taking subsequent measures to reduce and effectively manage it, fully in line with the bmw group's declared strategy of continuous improve- ment. purchasing and supplier network task force on climate-related financial disclosures (tcfd) in its reporting procedures, the bmw group also takes the rec- ommendations of the task force on climate-related financial disclosures (tcfd) into account in order to report on climate risks and opportunities for operational and finan- cial reporting purposes. firstly, it reports on this topic in detail in its bmw group report and secondly in the cdp questionnaire, which has incorporated the tcfd recommendations since 2018. the bmw group's 2020 cdp questionnaire is available on the tcfd-index in the ap- pendix provides a compact overview of the key statements con- tained in the four tcfd core elements as well as their location in the bmw group report and the cdp questionnaire. bmw group website. the tcfd index co2 in the supply chain: trend reversal and significant reduction in view of the increasing number of electric ves on roads worldwide, far greater attention will also have to be paid to upstream value creation when it comes to reducing carbon emissions going forward - particularly in light of the energy-intensive production of high-volt- age batteries. due to the greater proportion of electrified ves, carbon emissions generated per ve in the bmw group's supply chain are set to rise by more than one-third by 2030 if no countermeasures are taken. at the same time, as the volume of carbon emissions gener- ated during the use phase decreases, the total percentage of emissions caused by the supply chain and attributable to the group will increase. this situation requires the bmw group to set its own strategic targets. the group not only aims to halt the rise in the level of carbon generated by the supply chain that would be expected without taking countermeasures (scope 3 up- stream), it also intends to reduce emissions per ve by at least 20 () * by 2030 (base year 2019). in its efforts to achieve this aim, among other measures the bmw group is establishing the carbon footprint of the supply chain as a decision-making criterion when awarding contracts. with this end in mind, the group took the step of initiat- ing a dialogue with its most important suppliers in terms of their carbon footprint during the period under report. the bmw group is playing an exemplary role in working with well-documented and measurable carbon emission targets for its supply chain. * value rounded for simplification purposes. the target percentage validated in conjunction with sbti is 22 %. bmw group combined management report report 2020 (cid:42)eneral information and (cid:42)roup (cid:51)rofile 49 responsible use of resources - entering the circular economy not only decarbonisation but also the responsible use of resources plays a key part in the bmw group's strategy. in practical terms, this means primarily avoiding waste or reducing it to an absolute minimum. however, as resources are scarce and many raw materials are only available in limited quantities, the reuse of materials and raw materials in the form of secondary materials is becoming increasingly key for manufacturing processes going forward. for example, the growing popularity of electric mo- bility worldwide cannot be covered by primary materials alone in the long term. furthermore, there is a strong synergy between the conservation of primary natural resources and carbon dioxide emissions. therefore, from a sustainability perspective, the underlying flows of resources require some rethinking. the bmw group aims to obtain high-quality secondary materials through promoting a greater degree of transparency in the re- cycling chain and simultaneously tracing the reuse of (secondary) raw materials within the cycle. the group has the clear objective of promoting the cir- cular economy principle by using raw materials even more efficiently in order to protect nature's finite resources. even today, ves are already required to be 95 % recyclable. however, the proportion of secondary raw materials used to manufacture new ves is still com- paratively low. in view of this key point, the bmw group plans to considerably increase this proportion in its ves by 2030 - and is already exploring some very far-reaching scenarios. the use of secondary materials again significantly reduces carbon emissions in compari- son to primary materials - by as much as 80 % in the case of aluminium, for example. keeping the extraction of raw materials to a minimum is an ideal way of protecting ex- isting resources. in the case of critical raw materials, for example, any political conflicts in the producing coun- tries could also give rise to risks for the bmw group's procurement activities, which can be mitigated through the use of secondary products. particularly in view of the high-voltage batteries needed to power electrified ves, which can entail the use of critical raw materials, the circular economy has a decisive role to play. in close collaboration with the german recycling specialist , the bmw group has developed a process that can achieve a recycling rate of up to 96 % - including the graphite and electrolytes these devices contain. the bmw group already offers all customers who own a ve equipped with a high-volt- age battery to take the devices back free of charge. the offer also applies to regions where it is not legally obliged to do so. in order to monitor and verify flows of goods on a global basis, the bmw group is also using digital tools in pilot processes, including blockchain technology. the partchain project, for example, enables the group to collect supply chain data using a method that is both verifiable and tamper-proof at all times. in the long term, this technology could enable critical raw materials in par- ticular to be fully traceable from the mine to the smelter. resource consumption and resource efficiency securing long-term success in order to create value for the bmw group, the environment and society in general, sustainability is integrated throughout the entire value chain and all its underlying processes. and the evidence of how this group strategy is being implemented underlines its tan- gible impact. it sets out clear guidelines and points the way forward in terms of how the bmw group intends to shape the individual premium mobility of tomorrow. the bmw group will move forward in its own independent way and continue the long-term process of developing on a sustainable and profitable basis. the bmw group's strategic goals up to the years 2025 and 2030 respectively are summarised in the presenta- tion below: bmw group combined management report report 2020

(cid:51)rofile 51 managing sustainability the bmw group's long-term strategic course is determined by the full board of management, which is therefore also responsi- ble for implementing the group's sustainability goals. in 2019, the separate format of the board of management's sustaina- bility board was fully incorporated into the regular meetings of the board of management, enabling sustainability issues to be even more systematically integrated within the bmw group's decision-making processes. since then, sustainability has been treated like every other topic and discussed at board of manage- ment meetings as the need arises. moreover, all requests for de- cisions referred to the board of management are required to be assessed beforehand in terms of their sustainability. a strategy and structure circle, comprising the top management of the vari- ous company divisions, prepares the drafts of decisions to be tak- en for the board of management after also taking sustainability issues into account. the bmw group's corporate governance principles are set out in corporate governance statement. detail in its gri 102-18, 102-19, 102-20, 102-26, 102-27, 102-31,

qualitative criteria. these in- clude ecological innovations ( reductions), leadership accomplishments and the ability to manage change processes. additional criteria include enhancing the company's attractiveness as an employer, progress in implementing the di- versity concept and activities that encourage corporate citizen- ship within the bmw group. gri 102-27, 102-28, 102-35 management system the bmw group's business management system fol- lows a value-based approach that focuses on profitability, consistent growth, value enhancement for capital pro- viders, sustainability, climate protection and job security. capital is considered to be employed profitably when the amount of profit generated sustainably exceeds the cost of equity and debt capital. this strategy also secures the desired degree of corporate autonomy in the long term. the bmw group's internal management system is based on a multilayered structure. operating perfor- mance is managed primarily at segment level. in order to manage long-term corporate performance and assess strategic issues, additional key performance figures are taken into account within the management system at group level. in this context, the value added serves as one of several indicators for the contribution made to enterprise value during the financial year. this approach is made operational at both group and segment level through key financial and non-financial performance indicators (value drivers). the link between value added and the relevant value drivers is presented in a simplified form below. bmw group - value drivers value added - return on capital ( or roe) x return on sales capital turnover cost of capital / / x profit - expenses revenues capital employed average weighted cost of capital rate bmw group combined management report report 2020 (cid:42)eneral information and (cid:42)roup (cid:51)rofile 52 due to the very high level of aggregation, it is i am- practical to manage the business on the basis of value added. this key indicator is, however, used for reporting purposes. in addition, relevant value drivers having a sig- nificant impact on business performance and therefore on enterprise value are defined for each controlling level. the financial and non-financial value drivers are reflected in the key performance indicators used to manage the business. in the case of project-related decisions, the target system follows a project-oriented management logic that is based on net present values and profitability performance indicators, thereby providing a fundamental basis for decision-making. management of operating performance at segment level operating performance at segment level is managed at an aggregated level on the basis of returns on cap- ital. depending on the business model, the segments are measured on the basis of return on total capital or return on equity. specifically, return on capital employed () is used for the automotive and motorcycles segments and return on equity (roe) for the financial services segment. these indicators combine a wide range of relevant economic information, such as profitability (return on sales) and capital efficiency (capital turnover) to measure segment performance and the development of enterprise value. automotive segment profit before financial result and the average capital employed in the segment. the strategic target for the automotive segment's is 40 %. the most comprehensive key performance indicator used for the automotive segment is . this indica- tor provides information on the profitability

incur interest ( payables and other provisions). due to its key importance for the group as a whole, the automotive segment is managed on the basis of additional key performance indicators that have a significant impact on and hence on segment performance. these value drivers are the number of ve deliveries and the operating return on sales (ebit margin: segment profit before financial result as a percentage of segment revenues) as the key performance indicator for segment profitability. furthermore, the segment manages its compliance with fleet co2 targets in regulated markets. this also includes the proportion of total deliveries accounted for by electrified ves. since compliance with regulatory requirements has a significant impact on the company's success, business decisions relating to ve projects also take fleet co2 requirements into consideration. in order to take account of the increasing relevance of carbon emissions over the life cycle of a ve, in 2020 a control logic was agreed upon to measure this factor during the manufacturing phase (supplier network, logis- tics, production). bmw group combined management report report 2020 (cid:42)eneral information and

capital in EUR million return on equity in % strategic management at group level strategic management and the quantification of financial implications based on long-term corporate planning are performed primarily at group level. key performance indicators in this context include group profit before tax and the size of the workforce at the year end. group profit before taxes provides a comprehensive measure of the group's overall corporate performance after consolidation effects and a transparent basis for comparing performance over time. the information provided by these non-financial performance indicators is complemented by the two financial key performance indicators of pre-tax return on sales and value added. value added, as a highly ag- gregated performance indicator, also provides an insight into capital efficiency and the (opportunity) cost of cap- ital required to generate group profit. a positive added value means that a return on investment above the cost of capital has been achieved. bmw group combined management report report 2020 (cid:42)eneral information and (cid:42)roup (cid:51)rofile value added group in EUR million bmw group earnings

capital employed) capital employed comprises the average amount of group equity and pension pro visions as well as the financial liabilities of the automotive and motorcycles segments employed at the end of the last five quarters in each case. the earnings amount corresponds to group profit before tax, adjusted for interest expense incurred in conjunction with the pension provision and the fi- nancial liabilities of the automotive and motorcycles segments (profit before interest expense and taxes). the cost of capital is the minimum rate of return expected by capital providers in return for the capital employed. since capital employed comprises an equity capital (e. g. share capital) and a debt capital element (e. g. bonds), the overall cost of capital rate is determined on the basis of the weighted average rates for equity and debt capital, measured using standard market procedures. the pre-tax average weighted cost of capital for the bmw group in 2020 was 12 %, unchanged from the previous year. in order to determine the internal rate of return, risk-adjusted cost of capital rates are based on the average of actual rates in recent years. in light of the long-term nature of product and investment decisions, the follow- ing internal rates of return are used in conjunction with segment management: in % automobile motorcycles financial services value-based management for project decisions operational business in the automotive and motor- cycles segments is largely shaped by the life-cycle-de- pendent character of investment projects, which have a substantial influence on future business performance. project-related decisions are therefore a crucial element of financial management in the bmw group. 55 project decisions are based on calculations derived from the expected cash flows of each individual project. calculations are made for the full term of a project, in- corporating future years in which the project is expected to generate cash flows. project decisions are taken on the basis of net present value and the internal rate of return calculated for the project. the net present value indicates the extent to which the project will be able to generate future net cash in- flows over and above the cost of capital. a project with a positive net present value enhances future value added and therefore results in an increase in enterprise value. the internal rate of return of the project shows the aver- age return on the capital employed in the project. in this respect, there are conceptual links between the internal rate of return and the multi-year average . for all project decisions, the project criteria and long- term periodic results impact are measured and incorpo- rated in the long-term group planning. this approach enables an analysis of the impact of project decisions on periodic earnings and rates of return for each year during the term of the project. the overall result is a cohesive management model. bmw group combined management report report 2020 (cid:42)eneral information and (cid:42)roup (cid:51)rofile how the bmw group creates value within the bmw group, value creation is a com- prehensive process involving a broad range of positive factors, some of which interact in complex ways. these factors may be of a financial or a non-financial nature and relate to both tangible and intangible values that are geared towards creating additional value using a mini- mum of resources. these input factors form the basis that drives the bmw group's overall performance. according to the input-output model of the iirc framework, the factors on both the input and the output side are divided into six different types of capital, which can be distinguished as follows: 1. financial capital 2. human capital 3. intellectual capital 4. relationship capital 5. produced capital 6. natural capital 56 the bmw group's financial capital is defined in terms of equity capital and total assets, the latter cor- responding to the balance sheet total. an appropriately high equity ratio ( equity as a percentage of total assets) makes a significant contribution to safeguarding the corporate independence of the bmw group and forms a solid basis for high earnings and therefore stable dividends for the shareholders. stable relationships, which have developed over a long period of time in many cases, have created a capital of inestimable value, a fact amply demonstrated not least in the 2020 pandemic year. even under the challeng- ing conditions of the global lockdown in 2020, the bmw group's supply chains remained firm; a feat only possible when the partners share common standards and values and can truly depend on one another. purchasing the bmw group's solid economic base is inextricably linked with its human and intellectual capital. these two precious assets constitute the greatest factor in the enduring success of the group as a whole and play a key role in tackling the challenges of the future. they combine the knowledge, skills, abilities, strengths and talents of the bmw group's workforce and are among the most important value factors for the group. in its international r&d network, the bmw group offers its innovation-minded employees excellent condi- tions that enable them to create the solutions that will shape tomorrow's world. the high degree of motivation to innovate and the willingness to perform, both of which are firmly anchored throughout the entire work- force, are equally expressed in the lively participation in group-wide ideas management as well as in the outstanding level of employee satisfaction. a key pillar of the bmw group's personnel development strategy is to develop this success factor in a targeted manner. in addition to its many other levers, the group attaches great importance to the personal advancement of each individual, which also includes providing opportunities for further training. for the bmw group, innovation means rigorously taking the next step. in this context, it also collaborates closely with its partners in the supplier network. the and supplier network the backbone of the bmw group's produced capital is formed by the 31 plants in its global production net- work, across which it manufactured a total of 2.26 million premium ves during the 2020 reporting period. thir- teen of these plants (over 40 %) are already producing electrified ves alongside conventional models. natural capital describes all the renewable and non-renewable resources deployed in the manufactur- ing process. the bmw group is an efficiency-oriented company, and for that reason both the enterprise as a whole and its individual employees have always de- ployed natural resources sparingly as a matter of course. the consistently positive development of these capital indicators in recent years underscores this common corporate identity, a fact additionally confirmed by the assessments of independent rating agencies bmw stock and capital markets in 2020. all in all, these various aspects form the basis of the bmw group's enduring success. even minor changes in individual factors can directly influence the overall result. this holistic bmw group approach is intended to ensure that all available resources are used in a responsible man- ner. value added statement bmw group combined management report

compliance is an integral part of our corporate culture and the reason why share- holders, customers, business partners and the general public place their trust in us. the board of management and the employees of the bmw group are obliged to act responsibly and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. the bmw group also expects its business partners to conduct themselves in the same manner throughout the entire value chain. as an active corpo- rate member of the german institute for compliance (dico), the bmw group provides practical support for compliance management in germany and contributes to its further development. compliance as a corporate function the bmw group compliance management system is designed to ensure that the bmw group, its representa- tive bodies, its managers and staff act in a lawful manner at all company locations. particular emphasis is placed on measures to ensure compliance with antitrust legislation and avoid the risk of corruption or money laundering, as well as promoting respect for human rights. activities to avoid non-compliance with the law are managed and monitored by the bmw group compliance committee. 58 these activities include legal monitoring, internal compli- ance regulations, communications and training activities, complaint and case management, compliance reporting and compliance controls, as well as following through with sanctions in cases of non-compliance. regular compliance reporting to board of management and supervry board the bmw group compliance committee reviews the effectiveness and efficiency of the

coordination\" function was created within the financial services segment as a delegated function of the bmw group compliance committee office. based on an annual trend analysis, it identifies new or modified regulatory requirements in the financial services sector and defines the necessary measures. implementation by bmw group financial services companies worldwide is tracked on a quarterly basis. compliance is incorporated into the target man- agement process for the financial services segment. integration of specific targets into strategic management underlines the i am- portance of

group compli- ance management system are shown in the diagram on the previous page bmw group compliance management system and are applicable to all bmw group organisational units worldwide. the bmw group legal compliance code and bmw group code on human rights, which form the core of the group's compliance management system, are supplemented by an internal set of rules. the bmw group policy \"compliance\" sets out binding strategic requirements for bmw group compliance management, its premises and basic principles, as well as for implementation in the business departments. the bmw group policy \"antitrust compliance\", which establishes binding rules of conduct for all employees across the bmw group to prevent unlawful restriction of competition, was supplemented by several additional manuals in 2020 and deserves particular mention. the rules set out in the bmw group policy \"corruption pre- vention\" and the bmw group instruction \"corporate hospitality and gifts\" deal with lawful handling of gifts and benefits and define appropriate assessment criteria and approval procedures. the bmw group instruc- tion \"anti-money-laundering\" defines company-wide standards for anti-money-laundering for trade in goods and the financial services sector. compliance measures are determined and prioritised on the basis of a regular group-wide compliance risk assessment that relies on data-based risk indicators and transaction validation, among other methods. various internal media and communications ma- terials are used to raise awareness among staff across all compliance issues, including newsletters, employee newspapers and the compliance homepage in the bmw group intranet, where employees can find all compliance-related information and training materials. a compliance tone-from-the-top initiative called \"walk- the-talk\" was organised for the first time in 2020 to boost employee awareness of the importance of creating a cul- ture of transparency and trust. senior managers gave keynote speeches on a wide range of compliance issues at forums and employee meetings. the training opportunities offered by the bmw group compliance academy are refined on an ongoing basis for specific target groups. as well as imparting knowledge, online and classroom training options with company-spe- cific case studies play an important role in reinforcing compliance in the corporate culture. the online training modules must be repeated by the required target groups every two years and include a final test. successful com- pletion of the test is confirmed by a certificate. these courses are also offered on an optional basis to all other employees. bmw group combined management report report 2020 (cid:42)eneral information and (cid:42)roup (cid:51)rofile 60

prevention, and hold a valid training certificate. successful completion of the training programme is mandatory for all bmw group managers. the company makes sure that newly recruited managers and promoted staff receive compliance train- ing. online training in antitrust compliance is mandatory for managers and staff exposed to the associated risks as a result of their functions or on specific occasions. a total of more than 38,300 managers and employees worldwide have so far completed antitrust compliance training and currently hold a valid certificate. classroom and virtual training, as well as multi-day coaching sessions, are also held in local markets for all key compliance topics. one main emphasis here is on department-specific antitrust training - an area that was significantly expanded in 2020. gri 205-2 any member of staff with questions or concerns relating to compliance is expected to discuss these matters with their managers and with the relevant de- partments within

queries and concerns are documented and followed up by the bmw group compliance committee office using an electronic case management system. if necessary, corporate audit, corporate security, the legal departments or the works council may be called upon to assist in the process and address any issues. various it systems support bmw group employees with the assessment, approval and documentation of compliance-relevant matters. for example, all exchange activities with competitors must be documented and approved in a special compliance it system. the same applies to verifying legal admissibility and documenting benefits, especially in connection with corporate hospi- tality. the bmw group also uses an it-based business relations compliance programme to ensure the reliabil- ity of its business relations. relevant business partners are checked and evaluated for potential compliance risks. appropriate measures are implemented to manage compliance risks based on the results of the evaluation. a further it system is used to verify customer integrity as required under anti-money-laundering regulations. it solutions for automated reporting of compliance training activities and documentation of all compliance activities conducted by the business units were also under devel- opment during the reporting year. through the group-wide reporting system, compli- ance responsibles across all organisational units of the bmw group report, on both an ongoing and adhoc basis, on the compliance status of their respective units, on any identified legal risks and incidences of non-compliance, as well as on sanctions and corrective / preventative meas- ures implemented. compliance with and implementation of compliance rules and processes are audited regularly by corporate audit and subjected to control checks by the bmw group compliance committee office. corporate audit carries out on-site audits as part of its regular activities. the bmw group compliance committee also engages cor- porate audit to perform compliance-specific checks and, if necessary, brings in corporate security to investigate suspected cases. two bmw group compliance spot checks, sample tests specifically designed to identify potential corruption risks, and an antitrust compliance validation (to identify and audit possible antitrust risks) were carried out in addition in 2020. the organisational units for audit are selected on the basis of a group-wide compliance risk assessment. gri 205-1 in an antitrust investigation, the eu commission alleges that five german car manufacturers colluded with the aim of restricting competition for innovation with regard to certain exhaust treatment systems installed in diesel and petrol-driven passenger ves. the current

models cooperation between compliance and employee representatives managers, in particular, bear a high degree of re- sponsibility and must set a good example with regard to preventing infringements. managers throughout the bmw group acknowledge this principle by signing a written declaration, in which they also undertake to make staff working for them aware of legal risks. manag- ers must, at regular intervals and on their own initiative, verify compliance with the law. it is important to signal to employees that they take compliance risks seriously and that disclosing relevant information is extremely valuable. managers should remain open to discussion and consider differing opinions. any indication of non-compliance with the law must be rigorously investigated. sanctions management it is essential for compliance at the bmw group that employees are aware of and comply with applicable legal regulations. the bmw group does not tolerate violations of the law. culpable violations of the law result in them- ployment-contract sanctions and may involve personal liability consequences for the employee involved. compliance is also an important factor in safeguard- ing the future of the bmw group workforce. with this in mind, the board of management and the national and international employee representative bodies of the bmw group have agreed on a binding set of joint prin- ciples for lawful conduct. employee representatives are regularly involved in the process of refining compliance management within the bmw group. worldwide implementation of labour standards and respect for human rights bmw group models for ensuring compliance with environmental and social standards throughout its value chain are based on various internationally recognised guidelines. this especially applies to the guidelines for multi- un guiding principles on business and national companies issued by the organisation for economic cooperation and development (oecd), the human rights, the content of the able development and the united nations environment programme's (unep) declaration on cleaner production. the bmw group con- centrates on topics and action areas where it can exert its influence as a commercial enterprise. icc business charter for sustain- gri 102-12, 102-16 with the signing of the un global compact by the board of management of bmw ag in 2001 and the \"joint declaration on human rights and working conditions in the bmw group\", which was adopted in 2005 and up- dated in 2010, the bmw group has committed to abide by internationally recognised human rights and, specif- ically, the ilo core labour standards. the bmw group code on human rights and working conditions, which was published in 2018 to provide further clarification, was ratified by the board of management and employee representatives. this affirms the bmw group's com- mitment to human rights and outlines how it promotes respect for human rights and, specifically, how it imple- ments the ilo core labour standards in its business operations worldwide. the code was also part of the compliance communications initiative \"walk-the-talk\". the bmw group conducts specific training on the sub- ject of human rights: for instance, training purchasing staff to be aware of human rights issues. gri 412-2 in its annual compliance reporting, all organisational units of the bmw group are also asked for a local risk assessment of potential for human rights abuses. their responses form the basis for developing further measures for the department to minimise the risks. gri 412-1 bmw group combined management report report 2020 (cid:42)eneral information and (cid:42)roup (cid:51)rofile 62 specific human rights risks arise in the supply chain due to the collaborative, cross-border and conti- nent-spanning nature of value creation processes in the automotive industry. for this reason, the bmw group has integrated respect for human rights into its supplier sustainability policy and follows an appropriate risk manage- ment process. in addition to the company's international purchasing terms and conditions, bmw group dealer and importer contracts also contain a clause on com- pliance and human rights. human rights obligations are also considered in choosing sites and in important investment decisions. gri 412-3 in order to meet increasing requirements in the area of human rights, the bmw group discusses various legislative proposals at german and european level through associations and initiatives and participates in the automotive industry dialogue as part of the ger- man government's national action plan on business and human rights. the german federal ministry of labour and social affairs featured a practical example from the bmw group on its csr website. as part of its leadership of the csr / human rights working group of the german institute for compliance (dico), various as- pects of human rights management in companies were discussed among members and presented at the forum in october 2020. dico innovation and customer orientation on drivetrain technologies a constant striving for innovation, for something new and better, is a concept deeply anchored in the corpo- rate culture of the bmw group - in the thinking of its employees, in its processes and also in the identity of its brands. the benchmark and the goal of the bmw group's activities is to identify the wishes of customers worldwide in advance, in order to actively help shape trends and thereby drive transformation - a strategy discerniable in production ves such as the bmw ix *. in its develop- ment work, the bmw group focuses on two key areas. firstly, innovative digital solutions that make people's everyday lives easier and at the same time protect the environment, and secondly, as a premium provider in its industry, the group sees it as an obligation to offer cus- tomers a diverse range of customised, efficient drivetrain technologies ranging from all-electric drive systems, to plug-in hybrids and highly efficient internal combustion engines. this also includes hydrogen fuel cell technology, which the group believes could become an additional option in the long term. the bmw group's culture of innovation is most deeply rooted in its global research and development network. however, innovation is a lot more than that for the bmw group: throughout the entire company it is both the basis and the driving force behind the quest to replace the good with the better. innovative solutions benefit society in a number of ways: economically, eco- logically and socially. the dynamics of the markets in which the bmw group operates are largely determined by customer expectations and therefore by demand. the bmw group therefore focuses on the wishes and needs of its cus- tomers. market expectations have a direct impact on the range of ves on offer. how big does the ve need to be? which drivetrain variant fits your own lifestyle? for this reason, the bmw group offers a broad range of drivetrain systems and aims to offer corresponding electrified models for all of its brands and for every series. ultimately, a business model is successful and sustainable in the long term by offering tailor-made solutions and assuring customers who are confident in their purchasing decisions. since 2020, the bmw x3 has been the benchmark in this regard. it is now available in all four drivetrain variants: as an ix3 * with an all-electric drivetrain, as a plug-in hybrid or as a model powered by a highly efficient diesel or petrol engine.

drivetrains: a major leap in terms of production and sustainability the bmw group covers the entire process chain for electric drivetrains can the hydrogen fuel cell serve as a building block going forward? customer-oriented innovations frequently begin with basic research. built up over many years, the bmw group's expertise makes sustainable solutions possible. the new, in-house-developed electric motor does not contain any rare earth elements. the latest generation of batteries requires two-thirds less cobalt than its predecessors. the bmw group also considers the factor of sustainability when sourcing the cobalt it uses. the metal is acquired transparently via a certified process and supplied to the battery cell producers for further processing. details are available in the chapter purchasing and supplier network purchasing and supplier network. the bmw group has contractually agreed with the battery cell suppliers for the fifth generation of its edrive electric drivetrain that only green electricity from renewable sources will be used in their production pro- cesses, which should reduce carbon emissions by some ten million tonnes over the next ten years. in this fifth generation of the bmw group's electric drivetrain, the electric motor, transmission and power electronics are also installed within a compact space. the outstanding efficiency of the drivetrain components and the high energy density of the high-voltage battery enable ranges that conventional electric ves can only achieve with significantly larger and correspondingly heavier batteries and therefore lower efficiency. this electric drivetrain was deployed for the first time in the bmw ix3 *, which was launched in 2020. from 2021 onwards, further all-electric models such as the bmw ix * or the bmw i4 will be powered by this state-of-the-art technology. * see fuel consumption and co2 emissions information. whether electric motors, high-voltage batteries, charging equipment or power electronics - since 2011 the bmw group has gained extensive experience with all the components used in edrive technology and places its emphasis on in-house developments. by the end of 2022, all german ve plants will produce at least one fully electric ve. the production system is capable of manufacturing ves either with internal combustion engines or electric drivetrains on a single line and can therefore also respond flexibly in terms of the type of drivetrain required by the customer. this level of flexibility in production allows the bmw group to meet customer expectations in an ideal way. at the bmw group's battery research centre, work on battery cells is currently focusing on features that provide a high degree of customer value, including energy density, peak power, longevity, charging properties, costs, behaviour at various temperatures and, last but not least, safety. at the same time, the bmw group is building a pilot plant for lithium-ion battery cells near munich, making the bmw group the first automotive manufacturer to singlehandedly cover the entire process chain of electric driving and master it in technological terms. the bmw group is also investing in the enhanced development of hydrogen fuel cell technology. the bmw i hydrogen next, which is based on the x5, al- ready awakened a great deal of interest among visitors at the iaa 2019. in the long term, hydrogen technology could become a further component in the bmw group's drivetrain range. if the supply of renewably produced hydrogen can be ensured, this technology will provide an attractive option for combining emissions-free mobility with long-distance capability and short refuelling times. the bmw group is convinced that different forms of drivetrain will continue to exist side by side in the future, as customer expectations cannot be met with a single solution on an international basis. beginning in 2022, the bmw group will present a low-volume series of the bmw i hydrogen next featuring the second generation of its hydrogen fuel cell drive system. to make this aim a reality, the bmw group has been collaborating success- fully with toyota motor corporation since 2013. the new drivetrain technology will be combined with the fifth generation of the edrive, which will then generate its en- ergy from a fuel cell instead of a high-voltage battery. the bmw group has also developed this technology in-house as an overall system. however, the appropriate political and infrastructural framework conditions first need to be created if green hydrogen is to become widely available in sufficient quantities and at competitive prices. hy- drogen can also play a key role in powering heavy-duty and commercial ves with the aim of making logistics carbon-neutral going forward. the bmw group's leipzig and spartanburg plants have already been using trans- port ves powered by renewably produced hydrogen for a number of years. bmw group combined management report report 2020 (cid:42)eneral information and (cid:42)roup (cid:51)rofile 64 the bmw ix *: electric from the ground up in november 2020, the bmw group gave the public its first preview of the bmw ix, the first of which are scheduled for delivery to customers in the course of 2021. right from the start, the bmw ix was designed exclusively to provide electric mobility that is suitable for everyday use. the ve is powered by the fifth genera- tion of bmw edrive technology, which the bmw group has developed in-house and consists of twin electric motors, power electronics, charging technology and a high-voltage battery produced without the use of rare earths. fully electric and featuring four-wheel drive technology, it will enable ranges of over 600 km in the wltp cycle. equipped with innovative charging technol- ogy and a highly efficient drivetrain, the bmw ix can be charged to enable a range of over 120 km in a mere ten minutes. thanks to the development of new technologies, the kidney-shaped grille of the bmw ix has now been given a new function as a smart surface where camera technology, radar and other sensor-based features are located behind a transparent exterior. through the use of innovative materials, the surface of the grille also has a self-healing effect that makes light scratches disappear by themselves. moreover, as the first 5g-capable model to be made by a premium manufacturer, the bmw ix will also be the bmw group's technology flagship in terms of digitalisation going forward. in addition, gigabit eth- ernet technology is being used for the first time in this innovative ve, enabling extremely large volumes of data from sensors and antennas, for example, to be trans- mitted through the ve within fractions of a second and then processed in the centralised high-performance computers of the ve's on-board system. moreover, some of this data is also transmitted to the cloud, an- alysed and returned to the ve fleet, depending on the situation, creating new services for customers. for instance, information on danger spots detected by these ves, such as black ice, will be made available to the entire fleet, as well as tips on where a free parking space is most likely to be found upon arrival. when using all these digital technology innovations, the bmw group places great emphasis on ensuring that drivers and pas- sengers can perceive and operate new features intuitively, effortlessly and without distraction - regardless of how technically complex they may be. these functions are known as shy tech, technology that only becomes visible when needed. * see fuel consumption and co2 emissions information. artificial intelligence - the basis for automated driving and interaction with the vehicle since the end of 2020, over 400 data-driven and ai applications have been helping the bmw group pro- cess and interpret big data throughout all relevant areas of the company. artificial intelligence is also deployed when it comes to developing an algorithm that enables safe and predictive automated driving features, helping to analyse the approximately 250 million kilometres of \"experience\" gained to date (as of october 2020). even now, bmw group customers are already experiencing the capabilities of ai technologies as they drive. since the end of 2018, an intelligent personal assistant has been offering them support upon request. since the second half of 2020, more than 70 % of bmw ves have been equipped with the bmw intelligent personal assistant as standard. for example, commands given in natural speech enable drivers to comfortably operate numerous ve functions without having to take their hands off the steering wheel. customer-centric development via the bmw group's international development net- work, the varying regional needs and requirements of its customers worldwide are being incorporated into design, research and development. group locations worldwide are in direct dialogue with their various regions. the bmw group conducts an average of 70 customer studies per year in the area of display and operating concepts alone. the group also researches dialogue formats and upcoming trends. bmw group combined management report report 2020 (cid:42)eneral information and (cid:42)roup (cid:51)rofile 65 in a state-of-the-art innovation process, the bmw group also uses its ability to change perspectives when required. in this respect, it is the first automotive manufacturer to collaborate with epic games, a com- puter games developer. the bmw group has modified gaming technologies and adapted them for use in vehi- cle development as well as in production planning and customer presentation at the retail level. in the field of ve development, new components and systems can therefore be tested intensively at a very early stage so that they can later be used by the customer simply and intuitively to the greatest extent possible. technologies originating from the computer games industry such as mixed reality and game engines are key elements that are making an important contribution in this respect. internationally staffed teams of developers work simul- taneously and interactively with one another before hardware prototypes are additionally made available. in a mixed reality environment, technical solutions can be analysed at an early stage on a virtual ride before the first samples are made physically available, effectively cutting testing costs and, last but not least, minimising development times. the bmw group operates an international network of research and development locations to ensure that ideas can swiftly and directly become innovations for customers in the form of ideas to offer. the network provides the ideal environment for experts to work cre- atively in internationally connected teams to promote knowledge transfer and even faster, integrated, flexible collaboration for effectively developing the major trends of the future. this combined network of research and development expertise is continuously being expanded and strengthened in a competence-oriented manner. innovation culture in the making: a new centralised hub of the bmw group's global research and development network comes into being. the munich research and innovation centre (fiz) is the main hub of the group's international network of 14 research and development locations. the first phase of construction completed in the course of enlarging the munich fiz went into operation in autumn 2020. on the fiz campus, the focus is on transformation and the future-related topics of electrification, digitalisation and connectivity. with over 90 petabytes of storage capacity, 100 test benches, 200 laboratories and the directly adja- cent prototype construction facility, the fiz has grown to become one of the largest research and development centres in europe.

detect when they are entering an environmentally restricted zone or a city centre. they then automatically switch to electric mode after previously ensur- ing that the ve's battery is fully charged, enabling them to drive lo- cally emissions-free and almost silently where it has the greatest impact. charging management: electrified models are provided with addition- al information and services via the connected charging feature. pub- lic charging stations and their availability are displayed and addition- al information is also shown, for example on providers, opening hours or suggestions for places of interest and cafes or restaurants nearby. finding a parking space: customers can be assisted via various services when searching for a parking space. the on-street parking information, for example, calculates where a parking space is most likely to be free. digital key: in collaboration with apple, the bmw group is the first car manufacturer to offer its customers the option of using their iphone as a fully (cid:180)edged digital car key. it unlocks the ve at the door handle and the engine can be started when it is placed in the smartphone com- partment. access rights can be shared with other people and config- ured in the process and there is a specially designed mode for inexpe- rienced drivers. navigation / bmw maps: the cloud-based system has a great many ad- vantages. the route calculation feature combines real-time informa- tion with forecast models and therefore acts more dynamically and swiftly than ever. additional context-based information such as rat- ings, business opening hours and pictures of interesting places pro- vide bmw group customers with excellent support. entering a des- tination has now been made far more convenient due to the free text function, which uses a single search line and adds suggestions for rel- evant search terms. intelligent personal assistant: the bmw group has revamped the look of the bmw intelligent personal assistant and made it more emotion- al. the assistant is able to distinguish between the driver's and the pas- senger's speech, learns and even leans towards the respective conver- sation partner. apple car play allows navigation information from apple maps to be displayed on both the head-up display and the info display. google android auto is also integrated: customers can use

inspiration and cooperation in production scenarios, innovations can act in two different ways: they serve the purpose of conserving re- sources and thus further boosting efficiency production, purchasing and supplier network, but they can also help to implement new product ideas and design options. dig- italisation is thus also paving the way for completely new applications that enable owners to customise their ves, such as by adding individual equipment features for the mini. furthermore, the bmw group opened the additive manufacturing campus in summer 2020. production, research and even further training on the subject of additive manufacturing ( 3d printing) are combined under one roof at the location. the campus is also capable of manufacturing components for series production ves. the best ideas often come into being when different partners work together. regional bmw group technolo- gy offices are searching for promising young companies worldwide in fields of innovation such as sensor tech- nology, artificial intelligence, battery technology, smart materials, natural user interfaces and smart logistics. in which the strengths of the bmw group complement those of established partners also help to enhance the innovative strength of the bmw group. and partnerships for the bmw group, main- taining its innovation network also includes intensive dialogue with selected colleges and universities. every year, thousands of students come to the bmw group to complete an internship or write a scientific thesis. many group employees also work as lecturers at universities and higher education institutions. the bmw group maintains close partnerships with six universities and research institutions to conduct joint research projects that combine knowledge transfer with the training of highly qualified junior staff. the remote software upgrade function keeps bmw ves continuously up to date. the software updates can be conveniently downloaded to the ve whether at home or on the road and contain improvements or even fully new ve features. in autumn 2020, the bmw group rolled out the most extensive remote soft- ware upgrade in its history. the free-of-charge improve- ments and new attractive features were made available over-the-air to more than 750,000 bmw operating system () (version 0() / 20) ves worldwide. moreover, remote software upgrade allows drivers to purchase and activate additional optional features. for example, the highbeam assist or active cruise control with the stop&go function can also be subsequently in- stalled quickly and easily over the air, even on ves that have already been delivered to customers. customers can therefore benefit from the latest technological devel- opments and have the opportunity to test functions that were not yet needed at the time of purchase for a certain period of time with the option to purchase them. apps have been offering customers an effortless connection between their smartphones and the ve since 2013. a new generation of the my bmw app has been available on 30 european markets as well as in china and korea since december 2020. my bmw is the new universal interface

connection between products and its customers via its design, it also designs and builds its ves to meet the highest safety standards, as it considers the safety of its ves an essential part of its product responsibility. by including a raft of active and passive safety measures, the bmw group is able to reduce the risk of accidents and injuries not only for ve occupants, but for other road users, too. above all, these safety measures include optimised chassis tuning, highly effective braking systems, stable passenger compartments and airbags, but also digital driver assistance systems such as active cruise control, collision warning, lane guidance and emergency braking assistants. bmw group combined management report report 2020 products and services 74 reducing pollutants comprehensive information on safety aspects data protection is a key task right from the design stage of its ves, the bmw group consciously avoids the use of problematic materials and substances and takes active steps to keep emissions within the passenger compartment to a mini- mum. with this design strategy, the bmw group seeks to ensure that legal requirements regarding product safety, human health protection and the environment are com- plied with worldwide for each phase of the product life cycle, including development, use, recycling and disposal. in addition, all bmw, mini and rolls-royce brand vehi- cles are equipped with passenger compartment air filters as standard, which filter out pollutants and particles such as dust or pollen from the outside air. in 2020, the bmw group installed passenger com- partment filters featuring nanofibre filter technology for the first time, which keep certain microbial particles and allergens as well as ultra-fine particulate matter from entering the ve's passenger compartment. also in 2020, nanofibre filters were installed for the first time in a rolls-royce as standard. from 2021, however, the innovative technology will gradually become available for numerous other bmw group ve models. the bmw group provides customers with compre- hensive information on the correct use of its products and services. information on health and safety as well as the proper use of its ves is provided in printed form in the integrated owner's manual and is also avail- able electronically via a smartphone app or online. the information is supplemented by notes and additional background information on services, accessories and ve components. driver training to promote greater road safety the bmw group offers training for bmw and mini brand automobiles as well as bmw motorcycles in over 30 countries. in the bmw and mini driving experience, it raises awareness of potentially dangerous situations and thus also contributes to road safety in general. de- spite global restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic, the driving experience trained over 70,000 participants worldwide at various international locations in 2020. the bmw group views data protection as one of the most important tasks of digitalisation. it takes data pro- tection into account at an early stage in the development of its functions and services in order to ensure transpar- ency, informational self-determination and data security for its customers. in order to maintain this high level of data protection in the long term, the bmw group's products and services are always developed according to security-by-design principles and continuously tested for security aspects (cybersecurity) throughout their entire life cycle. the bmw group's product responsibility also includes the secure transfer of ve data to third parties. for this reason, bmw group ves are not directly connected to the internet, but communicate directly and exclusively with the bmw connecteddrive back-end service via a secure connection in a virtual private network. this precaution minimises the risk of unauthorised third parties gaining access to the ve or the driver's personal data. the point of access to the internet is controlled via a gateway. the bmw group considers the provision of ve data via a secured back end (extended ve approach in accordance with 20078) the best solution for ensuring data security and thus a high level of data protection. bmw group combined management report report 2020 products and services 75 in may 2017, the bmw group introduced bmw and mini cardata for the secure transmission of data to third parties. cardata is already available to bmw and mini customers across all european markets. can adjust their privacy settings to suit their own personal needs, either within their ves or on the connecteddrive portal, thereby retaining their right to informational self-determination. they can decide at any time which data to share with service providers (such as workshops, insurance companies and fleet manag- ers) in order to receive customised service offers. the bmw group has also been offering this service in the usa since april 2020. furthermore, the group works closely with the relevant data protection supervisory authorities to clarify fundamental data protection issues that relate to the increasing connectedness of its ves with the environment. for example, as a member of the german association of the automotive industry (vda) and the european association of the automotive industry (acea), the bmw group supports the principles on data protection they have drawn up. these principles focus on transparency, the informational self-determination of customers and the technical protection of data in their ves. ensuring safety with quality management continuous further development of safety systems all bmw group ves are subject to stringent safety tests during development and production, some of which are even stricter than those prescribed by law. the bmw group's quality management does not end at the factory gate, but also extends to ves that customers are already using. if any deviations from the group's strict quality standards are observed in their markets, it systematically follows up on these indications. if neces- sary, the group informs the relevant authorities without delay and initiates any measures that may be required. the bmw group take voluntary technical action even if there is no immediate danger. any ves potentially affected are checked, and if a fault is detected the cor- responding components are replaced. if there is a safety risk of any kind, the bmw group implements technical measures in collaboration with the relevant authorities. for this reason, the group has established appropriate committees, processes and organisations that are man- aged by the product support, technical actions and warranty costs department. gri 416-1 by systematically developing and improving its safety systems, the bmw group is helping to reduce the risk of accidents and injuries for all road users. an important in- dicator of this risk is the european new car assessment programme (euro ncap), a scheme for assessing the safety of ves in the event of a crash. the results of the most recently assessed ves (four top euro ncap ratings for the bmw 1 series, bmw 2 series gran coupe, bmw 3 series and bmw z4) once again demonstrate the bmw group's premium standards in terms of ve safety. in the years to come, the bmw group will continue working to additionally enhance the safety of its ves. apart from constantly optimising the passive safety of each individual ve, the group is also focusing on improving road safety standards by means of connected and automated driving. this applies, for example, to the bmw ix *, which was unveiled during the year under report and will go into series production in 2021. with its even more efficient sensor technology, the ve will be equipped with new and improved automated driving and parking functions and set new standards for the bmw group. * see fuel consumption and co2 emissions information. bmw group combined management report report 2020 products and services carbon emissions and pollutants the fight against climate change is crucial for the future of our society - and thus also for that of the bmw group. for this reason, it is placing sustaina- bility in the centre of its corporate strategy. in future, the bmw group intends to be even more systematic in examining not only the economic, but also the ecological and social impact of its corporate decisions. the group has therefore also committed to the requirements of the paris climate agreement that are relevant to it and set itself the target of establishing a climate-neutral business model across its entire value chain by the year 2050. in 2020, the bmw group undercut the eu's manu- facturer-specific fleet carbon emissions limit of 104 g / km by achieving a figure of 99 g / km according to internal calculations. at the same time, it also accomplished the goal it set itself in 2012 of halving the carbon emis- sions generated by its european new ve fleet by 2020 compared with 1995. furthermore, the bmw group will continue to work successfully on constantly reducing its carbon emissions going forward. the bmw group aims to provide its customers with the best offers world- wide, also in terms of sustainability. for this reason, the bmw group's drivetrain technology is based on two factors - highly efficient combustion engines and electric mobility. 76 new targets for decarbonisation by 2030 the bmw group is committed to achieving long- term carbon neutrality by 2050. guided by this principle, it is taking extensive measures to substantially reduce the carbon and other pollutant emissions generated by its ves, as it has done in the past. in the year under report, the bmw group therefore set itself specific new targets derived from the science based targets initia- tive (sbti) in order to further cut its carbon emissions below the level already achieved and is taking a holistic approach to accomplishing this aim. in this context, the group intends to achieve a mitigation corridor across all the activities for which it is responsible that corresponds to the defined target set out in the 2015 paris climate agreement, to limit global warming to between 1.5 and 1.75 degrees celsius. within the value chain, this includes all three scopes defined under the umbrella of the science based targets initiative (sbti). by 2030, the bmw group therefore intends to reduce the average car- bon emissions generated by its new car fleet in the use phase by 40 % compared to 2019 (scope 3 downstream). furthermore, the bmw group is scrutinising its entire value chain and striving to significantly reduce carbon emissions from the supply chain (scope 3 upstream), its production processes (scope 1 and 2) and the entire use phase. these targets have been notified to the sbti and validated. recording carbon emissions from scope 1 to scope 3 the carbon emissions generated by a given company are record- ed in various categories. the greenhouse gas protocol, a part- nership between the world resources institute (wri) and the world business council for sustainable development (wbcsd), distinguishes between scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 emissions, based on their various sources. whereas scope 1 emissions are generated within a company through the combustion of fossil fuels, scope 2 refers to the indi- rect emissions caused by the consumption of electricity and heat from externally generated sources of energy. scope 3 emissions are generated in the upstream and downstream stages of the val- ue chain, both in the supply chain (upstream) and in the subse- quent use of products and services (downstream). fleet carbon emissions further reduced the development of sustainable products and servic- es has long been an integral part of the bmw group's business model. the early fleet-wide use of efficient dy- namics technologies (since 2007) and the electrification of ves (since 2013) are continuously reducing carbon emissions in the long term. these twin factors form the basis for complying with and even undercutting legally prescribed carbon emissions and fuel consumption limits. more than - 40 % drop in carbon emissions generated by the new car fleet in the use phase by 2030 bmw group combined management report report 2020 products and services taking all regulatory requirements () into account, the average carbon emissions generated by the bmw group's new car fleet within the eu (including norway and iceland) according to the nedc (cid:230) in the year under report amounted to 99 g co2 / km (cid:231). the bmw group therefore reduced its fleet carbon emissions by 28 g co2 / km com- pared to the previous year (2019: 12() g co2 / km), approx- imately 5 g co2 / km below the limit of 104 g co2 / km applicable to the bmw group. between 1995 and 2020, the group's carbon emissions were reduced by around 53 % . this success was achieved through the consistent electrification of the ve fleet and the continuous improvement in the efficiency of combustion engines. gri 302-5, 305-5 worldwide, the bmw group reduced its fleet average carbon emissions by 5 % compared to the previous year to 133 g co2 / km (cid:230) in 2020 (simplified in- ternal bmw group calculation for its core markets eu, usa, china, ( and (cid:46)orea) (2019: 140 g

result, wltp fleet emissions must be retroactively calculated as nedc values for the purposes of reporting until and in 2020. 3 this is a preliminary internal calculation with a potential tolerance of + / - 0.5 g co2 / km, as official registra- tion figures have not been provided by all eu states. the eu commission is not expected to publish official figures until november 2021. bmw group combined management report report 2020 products and services 78 in the usa, the average fleet emissions () for the model year (m(cid:60)) 2020 amounted to 156 g co2 / km for passenger cars (m(cid:60) 2019: 15() g co2 / km) and 186 g co2 / km for light trucks (m(cid:60) 2019: 188 g co2 / km). fleet-weighted co2 emissions in the usa averaged 16() g co2 / km (m(cid:60) 2019: 16() g co2 / km - bmw internal calculation). in china, average carbon emissions (cid:230) rose slightly to 151 g co2 / km (2019: 144 g co2 / km). this is due to lower sales of electrified models in china, while overall sales are increasing. gri 302-5, 305-5 range of electrified vehicles further expanded the bmw group sees wide-ranging opportunities to further reduce fuel consumption and pollutant emis- sions in the electrification of power trains. this point is particularly relevant against the backdrop of global decarbonisation targets, for example in the eu, china or the usa (particularly california), and the sustainability targets the bmw group has set itself for 2030. for this reason, the bmw group again expanded its range of electrified ves during the 2020 reporting year. by 2030, the group plans to have delivered at least seven mil- lion electrified ves to its customers. electric mobility 7 million electrified ves delivered by 2030 conventional drivetrains more efficient and with lower emissions the bmw group continues to work intensively on reducing fuel consumption and carbon emissions in its conventionally powered ves. since 2007, the bmw group has been implementing its efficient dynamics package of technological measures through- out the fleet, comprising various coordinated measures to reduce fuel consumption. in this context, the group continued to optimise the efficiency of its combustion engines throughout the year under report by deploying recuperation systems and continuous emissions reduc- tion measures. recuperation systems utilise the energy recovered from the braking process to supply the vehi- cle's electrical system and generate additional power for the drivetrain. for this reason they are often referred to as mild hybrid ves. electrified ves since the early 1990s, the bmw group has managed to significantly reduce the pollutant emissions generated by its ves by deploying new technologies and mak- ing improvements to existing ones. in europe alone, it has reduced the relevant exhaust emissions of the new ve fleets for diesel passenger cars in accordance with the threshold values of the standards euro 1 to euro 6 from 1992 to 2019 by well over 90 % compared to the level recorded prior to the introduction of the euro emissions standards. gri 305-7 the introduction of new models with even lower-emissions drivetrain technologies has made a significant contribution to this result. in the year under report, the bmw group also converted all its remaining models to the euro 6d emissions standard. the bmw group expects modern, highly efficient diesel engines to continue playing an important role. as part of its efficient dynamics approach, the bmw group will therefore continue to work on reducing the consump- tion of conventional drivetrain systems and boosting their efficiency in the foreseeable future. it intends to continue along this route, taking innovative approaches to the combustion engine, aerodynamics and lightweight design. the use of 48-volt technology is another key component in the bmw group's efforts to reduce its carbon emissions. artificial intelligence (ai) can also contribute to cut- ting carbon emissions and ve fuel consumption. the bmw group is conducting research into how ai could make energy management in ves adaptive, enabling energy consumption to be modified to suit the needs of the driver and further improve energy efficiency. nitrogen oxide levels are a crucial factor for the air quality in towns and cities. with this point in mind, since mid-2018 the bmw group has installed a highly effective combination of an nox storage catalytic converter (nsc) and an scr system (scr: selective catalytic reduction) with urea injection technology (adblue) in all bmw diesel models as well as in the larger mini diesels. as part of its continuous further development strategy, the bmw group has additionally improved the efficiency of its exhaust gas after-treatment technology by utilising an oxidation catalytic converter in conjunction with two scr catalytic converters. in 2020, this new technique was launched and rolled out across the group's product portfolio together with the revised generation of its diesel engines. 1 basis: usc (united states combined). 2 basis: nedc (new european driving cycle). 79 with this approach of taking the entire ve life cycle into account, the bmw group intends to realise its ambition of achieving substantial improvement from one ve generation to the next. the group implements its targets and assesses its progress during the development process based on a carbon footprint in accordance with the 14040 / 44 standard. electric mobility bmw group combined management report report 2020 products and services with the aim of spreading these innovations for improving air quality as swiftly as possible, the bmw group offered a scrappage bonus in germany in 2020. the move was intended to rejuvenate the passenger car fleet and thus contribute quickly and effectively to reducing nitrogen oxide emissions. in 2019 and 2020, there were already first signs of a noticeable reduction in nox pollution in german cities, partially due to the progressive renewal of the fleets of all automotive man- ufacturers. gri 416-2 matters agreed therein are valid for every state in the usa - one of the bmw group's largest sales markets. the commitments made enhance the group's long-term planning security in the face of political change and are in line with increasingly stringent legislation worldwide designed to reduce ve emissions. in view of the growing popularity of electric mobility, for example, the bmw group sees the rapid expansion and technical harmonisation of charging infrastructure as an urgent requirement. in the usa and europe in particular, the slow pace of infrastructural expansion is still holding back the spread of electric mobility. successful reduction surpasses legal requirements the bmw group has the clear ambition to meet statu- tory carbon emissions requirements. within the eu, the group succeeded in improving on fleet carbon targets during the year under report. with respect to fleet car- bon limits in other regulated markets, the bmw group is also explicitly aiming to comply with the limits and keep its emissions as far below them as possible, which it again succeeded in doing in the year under report. the bmw group supports the development of har- monised national regulations, also on an international basis to the extent possible. comparable regulations in major markets create reliable, predictable framework conditions that make a key contribution to combating climate change and improving air quality. in view of its commitment to complying with the climate goals enshrined in the paris agreement, during the year under report the bmw group entered into a voluntary agreement with the us state of california to reduce fleet emissions over and above national requirements. the management over the entire life cycle in order to meet market-specific fleet requirements and its own even more ambitious decarbonisation tar- gets, the bmw group is taking an holistic approach to reducing emissions throughout the entire life cycle of its ves. this approach is particularly relevant, as - de- spite the expansion of electric mobility having an overall positive impact on carbon emissions in the use phase - emissions levels in the supply chain are increasing due to the use of more carbon-intensive components, especially those installed in high-voltage battery systems. for this reason, right from the product development stage of new ve projects, the bmw group has defined specific targets for reducing carbon emissions across the entire life cycle. the strategy applies equally to the ve de- velopment, the supply chain, production, the use phase, and finally recycling at the end-of-life phase. bmw group combined management report report 2020 products and services 80 electric mobility ambitious targets for expanding electric mobility product offering expanded and sales volume increased electric mobility is one of the key topics of the future when it comes to making road travel sustainable and a more pleasant experience. in recent years, the bmw group has significantly expanded its range of electrified ves and related services. it therefore sees itself as one of the leading providers of premium electric mobility, measured on the basis of its cumulative sales volume figures between 2013 and 2020 and in light of the holistic approach it is taking. the bmw group's electrified ves combine the advantages of sustainable mobility with dynamic drive- train behaviour. fully electric battery-powered models (bevs) generate zero local emissions and can significantly reduce traffic noise levels in towns and cities. the bmw group is pursuing the goal of substantially further decarbonising its ves and thereby achieving a worldwide reduction in carbon emissions in the use phase (scope 3 downstream in accordance with sbti carbon emissions and pollutants and paris climate agreement targets. a key part of its product strategy is therefore to systematically continue electrifying its model range. the bmw group has set itself ambitious targets: by 2025, the proportion of electrified ves in its total deliveries is to rise to at least 25 %. by 2030, the bmw group plans to have delivered at least seven million electrified ves (). to ensure that it achieves its sales volume targets for electric and plug-in hybrid ves, the bmw group plans to more than double its sales of electrified vehi- cles by the end of 2021 compared with 2019 figures (2019: 146,158 (cid:230) units). based on its existing plans, the bmw group will have 25 electrified models on the road by 2023. the bmw group is consciously focusing on battery electric ves (bev) and plug-in hybrid technology (phev), enabling customers to select the form of drive- train that best suits their respective mobility needs. in order to serve regionally varying customer requirements, the bmw group assembles a variety of drivetrain tech- nologies on the same production line. during the year under report, the bmw group launched further models with hybrid drivetrains: the bmw x1 xdrive25e (cid:231), x2 xdrive25e (cid:231), x3 xdrive 30e (cid:231), 330e touring (cid:231), 330e xdrive sedan (cid:231), 330e xdrive tour- ing (cid:231), 530e sedan (cid:231), 530e touring (cid:231), 530e xdrive sedan (cid:231), 530e xdrive touring (cid:231) and 545e xdrive sedan (cid:231). these were joined by two additional all-electric models, the mini cooper se (cid:231) and the bmw ix3 (cid:231), which has been available in europe since the end of january 2021. the bmw ix3 (cid:231) is already equipped with the technology of the fifth, and thus latest, generation of bmw group battery cells. glossary. 1 see 2 retail ve delivery data presented for 2020 is not directly comparable to

factors, including personal driving style, route characteristics, the outside temperature, heating, air conditioning, preheating and precooling. provisional figure. range increased to meet customer needs further investments in electrification the bmw group invests on an ongoing basis in the planning and development of new ve models. the figure of 25 electrified models previous targeted to be on the roads by 2025 has now been brought forward to 2023. around half of the 25 models will be offered as all-electric versions. the bmw group also intends to offer its high-volume models as purely battery-powered versions. from today's perspective, the european union's target of attaining climate neutrality by 2050, the interim targets discussed in the context of the green deal and the similarly ambitious climate policy targets of other countries can only be achieved with a variety of parallel technologies if customers are to continue being offered a range of mobility options that meet their specific and differing needs going forward. even today, from a global viewpoint there are driving profiles that cannot yet be covered by an all-electric ve due to physical or technical restrictions or insufficient access to a viable charging infrastructure. to enable customers to cover as much of their daily driving as possible emissions-free, the bmw group is sys- tematically increasing the electric range of its plug-in hy- brids (phev) and battery-powered electric ves (bev) by introducing new technologies. hence, for phevs, the group has increased the range of the bmw x5 p(cid:43)e(cid:57) () from 31 km (2015: nedc data) to 80 km (cid:231), the bmw 530e p(cid:43)e(cid:57) () from 45 km (201(): nedc data) to 60 km (cid:231) and the bmw 330e p(cid:43)e(cid:57) () from 40 km (2016: nedc data) to 60 km (cid:231). in the be(cid:57) segment, the range of the bmw i3 be(cid:57) () increased from 300 km (2016: nedc data) to 359 km (cid:231). to further increase the range of its electrified ves, the bmw group is improving both the energy density and the efficiency of its battery cells. for example, the high-voltage battery in the bmw ix3 () has a 20 () higher energy density and the power density of the electric motor has also been increased by 30 %. as a matter of principle, the bmw group takes a differentiated view to increasing the electric range and does not necessarily consider it expedient to aim for a maximum range for all electrified ves, and is rather of the opinion that it makes more sense to offer customers tailor-made solutions by producing a fleet of ves with varying ranges. resource use and resource efficiency - advantages that also benefit the customer. bmw group combined management report report 2020 products and services 82 phevs and highly efficient internal combustion engines are therefore a more likely choice in this envi- ronment. for these reasons, the bmw x3 * is the first model series to be available in two variants, firstly with a combustion engine and secondly as a plug-in hybrid version, thanks to the bmw group's scalable, modular construction system. the bmw ix3 * is also available with its all-electric drivetrain. quite apart from battery-powered electric drivetrain systems, the bmw group also continues to see the poten- tial of fuel cells, a technology embedded in the hydrogen strategy of various countries. the group is planning to produce a small series of the bmw i hydrogen next from 2022. moreover, as an associated partner of h2 mobility deutschland gmbh, the bmw group is in- terested in establishing the infrastructure required for hydrogen-powered ves. achieving sustainability over the entire life cycle the bmw group considers both decarbonisation targets and market-specific fleet requirements right from the product development stage. in doing so, it defines specific targets that ensure well-balanced optimisation over the entire life cycle. and other pollutant emissions as well as the use of critical materials over the entire life cycle of its ves right from the very beginning. with the fifth generation of bmw edrive, the group reached an important milestone during the year under report. a special feature of the electric motor, which is being installed in the bmw ix3 * for the first time (edrive gen5), has been designed so that it no longer requires the use of rare earth elements. for the fifth generation of its high-voltage storage system, the bmw group obtains any critical raw materials it re- quires from sources outside the known conflict regions. cobalt that is bought in directly by bmw group and made available to suppliers is sourced from morocco and australia. the lithium used is also from australia, where it is extracted by means of the so-called hard rock mining process. in addition, the bmw group has successfully reduced the amount of cobalt required per kwh by two- thirds through the further chemical development of its battery cells. purchasing and supplier network the use of renewable energy in production process- es - for example in the manufacture of energy-intensive materials such as carbon fibre reinforced plastic - or the choice of green electricity in the use phase - also help reduce the carbon footprint of the bmw group's ves. further information on how efficiently and therefore eco- nomically and sparingly the bmw group uses resources in its production processes is provided in the section resource consumption and resource efficiency. with its project i, the bmw group was among the first manufacturers to pursue the aim of reducing carbon the bmw group has entered into a contractual agree- ment with its battery cell manufacturers to ensure that they only use green electricity when producing the fifth generation of battery cells. in a joint technology consor- tium with battery manufacturer northvolt, the group also plans to configure the value chain for battery cells in europe with sustainability as its top priority. other approaches to handling resources in a respon- sible, sustainable manner include the reuse of batteries, such as in stationary storage systems with the aim of improving the use of renewable energy and promoting recycling. in collaboration with the recycling specialist , for example, the bmw group has developed the prototype of a process that enables 96 % of the mate- rial from battery cells to be recovered for recycling. , the option exists for all customers whose ve- contains a high-voltage battery for the bmw group to take the battery back free of charge. this also applies to regions where there is no legal obligation to do so. the bmw group manages the implementation of its targets and assesses progress in ve development via its life cycle assessment in accordance with the 14040 / 44 standard. the group utilises these assessments to record the environmental impacts occurring over the life cycle of a ve right from the development stage and make comparisons with predecessor models. howev- er, the bmw group's approach goes one step further: it breaks down the targets by product and then implements the appropriate measures. these include, for example, the use of green electricity for energy-intensive processes in the supply chain or in production as well as the use of recycled materials such as aluminium or plastics instead of deploying primary resources. * see fuel consumption and co2 emissions information. bmw group combined management report report 2020 products and services 83 the bmw group aims to ensure that electric and electrified ves make an effective contribution to climate protection not only in the use phase, but also in their overall footprint, including the supply chain. as an example, the environmental report of the bmw ix3 * indicates that the greenhouse gas potential values of an all-electric ve are around 30 % lower than those of a conventional reference ve with a diesel drivetrain when the calculation is based on standard consumption and the european electricity mix. furthermore, when the electricity used for charging is generated from re- newable energy sources, the emissions values are around 60 % lower. competence centre for battery cells in 2019, the bmw group began pooling its wealth of experi- ence and comprehensive knowledge of battery cell technology in a new competence centre based in munich. with this strategy, the group is pursuing the twin aims of further improving its bat- tery cell technology and fully penetrating production processes. based on the battery technology currently in use, the bmw group intends to substantially increase the potential range of its electri- fied ves by 2030 by continuing to develop its battery cells, modules and systems. looking to the future, the focus will be even more on cutting battery system costs in order to make elec- tric mobility more profitable. the competence centre replicates the entire value chain of bat- tery cell technology, from research and development to the struc- ture and the design of the battery cell to the production of the first prototypes. it takes the complete life cycle of a battery cell into ac- count, from purchasing the raw materials to recycling. particularly in view of the high-voltage batteries needed to power electrified ve- s, which can entail the use of critical raw materials, the circu- lar economy has a decisive role to play. production, purchasing and supplier network expanding the charging infrastructure and enabling faster charging a comprehensive charging infrastructure is a prereq- uisite for the rapid, widespread deployment of electric mobility. in order to promote this project, between 2015 and 2020 the bmw group committed itself to improving the charging infrastructure in a total of over 50 projects and has initiated the installation of some 15,000 opera- tional charging points. the bmw group plans to install a total of 4,100 charging points at bmw group properties in germany by the end of 2021. half of these charging points will be made accessible for public use. together with other car manufacturers, charging station providers, charging service providers and energy suppliers, the bmw group is working on simplifying not only access to charging stations, but also the charging process itself. at european level, in close collaboration with the ionity joint venture, the bmw group is in the process of building a high-performance fast-charging network com- prising some 400 charging stations along major transport routes by 2021. fast-charging stations make charging up to seven times faster than standard 50 kw stations. originally planned for completion by 2020, due to the coronavirus pandemic and the lack of approvals, the bmw group and its partners were compelled to postpone the construction of certain stations until 2021. to date, 325 of the 400 planned ionity fast-charging stations have been installed and a further 44 are currently under construction. at powerful and increasingly widespread dc fast-charging points with outputs of at least 150 kw, the bmw ix3 * can be charged to achieve a range of over 100 km (wltp) in around ten minutes. the bmw group intends to offer electric mobility to both private customers and companies operating entire fleets and is additionally expanding the bmw charging product and service portfolio for trendsetting charging solutions at home, on the road and at the workplace. charging infrastructure for both private and commercial purposes is a key prerequisite for the further expansion of electric mobility. the bmw group welcomes the sup- port provided by government premiums, as charging options both at home and at the workplace make a key contribution to the overall infrastructure from the point of view of customers. green electricity for e-mobility during the year under report, the bmw group continued to pursue and expand its approaches to the holistic ecological optimisation of electric mobility both at home and on the road. in addition to bmw charging and mini charging, the group already offers electricity from renewable sources as well as attractive solar power packages for homes in both germany and austria. as part of its strategic investment in the ionity joint ven- ture, the bmw group is preparing to broaden its range of services to enter other markets as well as the field of public charging. * see fuel consumption and co2 emissions information. bmw group combined management report report 2020 products and services 84 improving political conditions mobility patterns making urban mobility sustainable with services in the bmw group's view, there is still a need for political support for electric mobility in many countries and cities. in the eu, for example, market research points to the close correlation between the density of charging infrastructure and the sale of electrified ves. this correlation applies not only at member state level, but also in a regional comparison. the bmw group is therefore seeking dialogue with policymakers to call for measures to be taken to improve consistency on both the supply and the demand sides. in concrete terms, the aim is to improve framework conditions with the aim of stimulating demand for electrified ves not only nationally, but also at local level. the focus here is on increasing the number of public charging points and offering usage incentives in everyday life, such as park- ing spaces reserved for electric ves or discounts on parking fees. in germany, for example, only a few cities have so far taken advantage of the funding opportunities offered by the electric mobility act. to advocate for improved conditions, the bmw group is involved, for example, in the national platform for the future of mobility (npm), in the european initiative eit urban mobility and within the framework of the world economic forum. furthermore, the bmw group is in dialogue with think tanks such as and is a member of the international consultative com- mittee of china ev 100 as well as at veloz, a non-profit organisation dedicated to promoting electric mobility in the us state of california. the bmw group wants to make mobility more sus- tainable and more convenient to use. in recent years, numerous urban mobility offers have been developed and introduced in cooperation with selected towns and cities. the bmw group therefore sees its 2020 target of providing sustainable support for changing mobility behaviour by offering integrated mobility services in selected metropolitan regions as having been met. moreover, the group continues to work together with its subsidiaries and in dialogue with the respective cities to find solutions to the increasing density of road traffic and the corresponding rise in noise levels, air pollution and land use. the bmw group is also meeting these challenges by developing connected ves. in view of the growing trend towards ve electrification, the group is therefore making a significant contribution in particular to providing eco-friendlier modes of transport as well as promoting the better use of space in urban areas. the bmw group is currently working together with three german cities to improve the traffic situation and explore new mobility solutions. the new mobility berlin project aims to improve the quality of life within the city. for this reason, the bmw group is develop- ing tailor-made multimodal solutions, approaches that incorporate the entire range of transport modes. in selected districts of the city, via its subsidiaries, the bmw group offers shared fleets of rental cars and e-scooters as an alternative to privately used ves. the strategy is intended to encourage better use of the road space occupied by rarely used private ves for other purposes going forward. at the same time, the bmw group has reached agreements with the cities of munich and hamburg, where it has carried out the first pilot projects for making city centres more pleasant to live in. specific examples of the development of new, sustainable mobility options in- clude the research project, which focuses on measures to reduce traffic in project districts in munich and hamburg, and the \"umparken schwabing-west\" pro- ject, in which the bmw group is working to transform public space and enable it to be used more appropriately by offering mobility packages for local residents. the bmw group is also involved in various urban platforms via which municipalities exchange information and collaborate on projects, including the platform in germany and the international eit urban mobility platform of the european institute of innovation and technology. urban mobility bmw group combined management report report 2020 products and services 85 via its subsidiaries, the bmw group promotes innovative service offerings in the fields of car sharing, driving services, parking and ve charging as well as multimodal transport. in 2019, the bmw group there- fore merged its own mobility services in a joint venture with those of daimler mobility services gmbh to create the your now service. the common goal of the two companies is to expand the use of on-demand mobility and offer new solutions for cities and municipalities looking to make road use more efficient and sustaina- ble. in this context, the market development and the political-regulatory framework conditions in the cities are continuously being examined and the range of services further developed in collaboration with strategic partners. the bmw group has expanded its car-sharing service offering (share now) to include a long-term rental of up to 30 days. it also continued to develop free now into a multimodal mobility platform by adding e-bikes and e-scooters. in 2020, free now had 46 million registered customers and offers ride services in 17 countries and 153 cities. in the year under report, around 2.9 million customers used the share now car-sharing services, which are available in 16 cities and eight countries. the car-sharing fleet currently compris- es around 9,500 ves, almost one-quarter of which are electrically powered. in 2020, the number of trips decreased due to the coronavirus pandemic. the charge now ve charging service cur- rently provides access to around 246,000 public charging points operated by various providers in 32 countries. in addition to its charge now services, the bmw group is working with partners in other markets to provide cus- tomers with broad access to charging points. the park now digital parking service enabled around 45 million customers in around 1,200 cities to pay more quickly and easily for parking spaces on a contactless basis. however, park now's business performance was also impacted by the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. the bmw group and its subsidiaries are working continuously on intelligently interconnecting ves, infrastructure and mobility services. the aim here is to make better use of the limited parking space available and reduce traffic congestion. the bmw group is fully committed to complying with statutory limits for air quality, noise levels and carbon emissions as well as to restoring the quality of life for the residents of urban are- as. for these reasons, the bmw group intends to further intensify its dialogue with towns and cities and make an active contribution to the discussion on more sustainable mobility options as well as tailored traffic management measures. the group also intends to transfer the results achieved in individual cities to other areas and adapt them on an international basis. further developing automated driving automated functions and digitally connected ves can help reduce traffic congestion, minimise the risk of accidents and cut emissions levels. these technologies are therefore making a direct contribution to improving the quality of life in cities, and electric mobility in particular is becoming more and more popular at the same time. the latest bmw models are equipped with state-of-the-art driver assistance systems. in 2021, the bmw group is taking automated driving a decisive step further with the development of the bmw ix*. it will be the first bmw group ve to offer both automated driving and parking functions via a new modular tech- nology system. the bmw group sees considerable po- tential in automated driving and will continue to develop this field intensively over the next few years. employee mobility as the largest single employer in the munich metropolitan region, the bmw group has a special role to play in its hometown location and the surrounding urban areas by actively helping to reduce en- vironmental pollution. the group is planning to have one of the largest company charging networks in place by mid-2021, there- by helping to increase the popularity of electric mobility and re- duce carbon dioxide as well as other pollutant emissions. the bmw group provides incentives for its employees to use public transport, including benefits such as a discounted month- ly ticket within the munich city area. around 14,000 employees have chosen this option. the group also operates a long-estab- lished shuttle bus service between its locations. it also provides its staff with rental bicycles and scooters for commuting. last but not least, as a good example, with its bmw leaserad offer, the group is actively supporting the growing number of employees who choose to ride to work by bicycle and also encourages travel- ling by bicycle and scooter in general. * see fuel consumption and co2 emissions information. bmw group combined management report report 2020 products and services 86 the bmw group is also leveraging ve con- nectivity with its new edrive zones technology, which automatically switches plug-in hybrids to fully electric driving mode when entering an environmental zone. the innovation makes it easier for customers to drive emissions-free to the greatest extent possible. the group has already introduced this function in over 80 european cities. the safety of its automated systems is a top priority for the bmw group. for that reason, in 2019 it partnered with 11 leading companies in the field of automated driving to produce a safety first for automated driving () white paper that highlights the importance of safety by design in the development of an industry standard for automated driving. the bmw group sees this white paper as an important step towards defining industry-wide standards from the testing stage to the approval of highly and fully automated driving functions. since 2018, bmw assistance systems have been utilising artificial intelligence to anticipate typically dan- gerous situations such as the swerving of other ves in order to react in good time. the bmw group can further improve the performance of artificial intelligence in this field by analysing anonymised data taken from real-life activities. therefore, as a founding member of the european gaia-x project, it is committed to devel- oping standards for organising data and cloud-based measures with the aim of making traffic management more efficient. in order to incorporate highly mature new technolo- gies in series production and further raise its level of ex- pertise in the field of automated driving, the bmw group is building a new development and testing ground in the czech republic, which is scheduled for completion in 2022. complex everyday automated driving conditions can then be tested at the new facility in a realistic but controlled environment. independently which of their ve data are transmitted to other market participants for a specific purpose. the bmw group has also been offering this service in the usa since june 2020. design and product safety preventively protecting customer data identifying potential for sustainable mobility at an early stage the protection of data and information within the bmw group is based on the relevant laws and standards, particularly in accordance with the eu general data pro- tection regulation and the / iec 2()001 international security standard. the personal data of customers is only collected, processed or utilised to the extent legally permitted and with the consent of the person in ques- tion. any complaints can be reported to the customer interaction centre, the data protection officer or via the speakup line and will be dealt with promptly. in order to protect its digital systems from tampering, the bmw group systematically searches for possible weak points with a view to closing any potential gaps in good time before approving the respective component. the group continuously translates any new insights into binding standards. clear standards regarding data and information protection also apply to any collaborations and partner relationships. with bmw cardata, the bmw group introduced a secure, data-protection-compliant and transparent service for the non-discriminatory sharing of ve data, initially in germany in 2017 and since 2018 across europe. bmw cardata provides bmw group customers with complete data sovereignty. customers can decide the bmw group has combined the topics of sustain- ability and mobility in its corporate strategy. it analyses the opportunities and challenges arising from changes in mobility demand that result from new types of mo- bility on offer or regulatory framework conditions. the bmw group then develops premises for its contribution to sustainable mobility on this basis. in corporate depart- ments for both strategy and communication, the group has established dedicated teams in a global network and provided them with funding to jointly define sustainabil- ity goals and monitor the extent to which they are being achieved. the bmw group views developments in its main markets in a differentiated manner and engages in collaborative research projects in order to understand the changes, impacts and needs of urban mobility behaviour worldwide at an early stage. the group is also in regular dialogue with its international stakeholders. one of the aims of these established events is to gain a better un- derstanding of people's mobility needs worldwide and develop new products and services accordingly. dialogue with stakeholders

water, waste, energy, solvents, etc. we have achieved a great deal in recent years - for instance, reducing the amount of waste by 80 %. and all bmw group plants worldwide have obtained their electricity from renewable energies since 2020. the goal is to reduce co2 emissions in pro- another 80 % by 2030. how will you do that? we have already achieved a great deal when it comes to energy efficiency and sourcing green power. and we know where technology can still leverage potential. our next big topic will be gas consumption. supply chain co2 emis- sions are also meant to be reduced by 2030. ms perez szmak, why by only 20 %? without corrective measures, ex- panding electromobility would increase co2 emissions in the supplier networ(cid:78) by at least a third. we do not just want to stop this increase; we want to reverse it. so, actually, a reduction of at least 20 % is a very ambitious goal. renewable energies will play a big part in this. a second topic is the reuse of

91 the group's dingolfing plant has assumed a lead- ing role as a competence centre for e-drive systems in the production of electric drivetrain components. it produces battery modules, high-voltage batteries and fifth-generation electric motors for the bmw group's electrified ves. e-motors are also manufactured at the landshut plant. production facilities for battery components and high-voltage batteries are also being established at the group's leipzig and regensburg sites. currently, high-voltage batteries are manufactured at three bmw group plants, dingolfing (germany), spartanburg (usa) and shenyang (china). in thailand, the bmw group collaborates closely with a partner that manufactures high-voltage batteries for electrified ves that are produced locally. by 2024, the produc- tion of internal combustion engines in europe will be concentrated at bmw group locations in steyr (austria) and hams hall (uk). production network systematic transformation towards electric mobility the bmw group's production system is efficient and flexible. it provides customers with a large number of customisation options when choosing their own ve. moreover, during the reporting period the bmw group's global production system once again demonstrated its ability to respond to highly volatile market developments, even under the demanding conditions of the 2020 pan- demic year. the production network leverages innovative technol- ogies from the fields of digitalisation and industry 4.0, including applications from the worlds of virtual reality, artificial intelligence, smart logistics and 3d printing. 2022 every production plant in germany will be manufacturing at least one fully electric model the bmw group continues to accelerate towards electric mobility and is bolstering its international production network for the increased manufacturing of electrified ves. by the end of 2022, every production plant in germany should have the capacity to produce at least one fully electric ve model. the bmw group's production system is capable of manufacturing both con- ventional internal combustion and electrically powered ves on a single line, enabling it to respond flexibly to changing customer requirements for various drivetrain systems. in 2020, the group simultaneously manufac- tured electrified models at 13 locations in its global pro- duction network. by the middle of the current decade it will be deploying a new cluster architecture geared to fully electric drivetrains. initially, the technology will be launched at the future debrecen plant in hungary and then transferred to the global production network in a step-by-step process. electrification is also becoming increasingly impor- tant in terms of drivetrain production. in the year under report, the bmw group announced the construction of a pilot plant for the near-series production of battery cell prototypes. the aim is to further optimise the produc- tion of battery cells in terms of quality, performance and costs. the battery cell competence centre in munich already covers the entire value chain in terms of battery cell technology - from research and development to the structure and design of the battery cell as well as its manufacturability. bmw group combined management report report 2020 production, purchasing and supplier network production sites in key markets the bmw group's production network comprises 31 locations in 15 countries. the group aims to strike a balance between production and deliveries in the various regions of the world. 20 of the 31 sites are bmw

efficiency - 78 % co2 emissions per ve since 2006 the reduction of carbon emissions and the respon- sible use of resources are important cornerstones of the bmw group's strategy. its own plants and locations have a direct influence on both carbon emissions levels and resource consumption. the bmw group has been committed to resource-efficient production at its plants for many years. this includes checking and monitoring the consumption of resources across the bmw group's production network. the principle of continuous i am- provement applies throughout the bmw group. it in- vests in efficient technologies and also continually seeks to optimise its existing processes and procedures. this principle has been highly successful, as the group clearly surpassed its target of reducing resource consumption per ve produced by an average of 45 % by 2020 com- pared to 2006 , achieving an overall reduction of 56.() (). apart from continuously reducing energy consumption in general, the bmw group is now focusing on convert- ing its electricity supply to renewable energy sources. any remaining production-related emissions that cannot yet be avoided will be offset from 2021 onwards. new production targets up to 2030 the biggest lever for reducing the bmw group's scope 1 and scope 2 emissions is at its production locations, which account for around 90 % of these emis- sions. the bmw group has had considerable success in this area and repeatedly set new standards in terms of sustainable production methods. between 2006 and 2020, carbon emissions per ve produced fell by around 78 % by continually improving energy efficiency, generating renewable electricity in-house and entering into direct supply contracts for green power (including guarantees of origin). nevertheless, the bmw group has already set itself the next target: compared to 2019, these emissions levels are to be reduced by a further 80 % per ve by 2030. as from 2021, the group will make the remaining carbon emissions from scope 1 and scope 2 completely carbon- neutral by using voluntary offset certificates. 95 carbon in production reduced again carbon emissions per ve produced fell by around 23 % to 0.23 t compared with the previous year. the reduction is a result of completely switching the bmw group's production network to green electricity generated from renewable sources. the bmw group also

processes to an absolute minimum. apart from carbon emissions, further decisive factors are energy and water consumption, the amount of waste sent for disposal and the use of solvents. in recent years, the bmw group has made a great deal of progress in terms of resource consumption. between 2006 and 2020, the bmw group reduced its average re- source consumption and emissions generated per ve by 56.7 %, an improvement of 6.5 % year on year. the pandemic-related interruption of production at most bmw group plants had a significant impact on energy consumption per ve. when the produc- tion facilities were restarted, the same base load (cid:231) and simultaneously lower production volumes resulted in an overall increase in energy consumption per unit. although the bmw group's energy consumption fell to 5,714,610 mwh (2019: 5,974,625 mwh) in absolute terms during the pandemic energy consumption in detail, energy efficiency was negatively impacted by lower unit volumes and not least also by hygiene measures such as the requirement to increase the frequency of venti- lation. the bmw group's specific energy consumption for ve production in 2020 therefore rose by 3.9 % to 2.12

plants. the bmw group has investigated the use of water sources other than drinking water in a number of its plants in future. it focused on locations in dry climatic regions, such as the plant in san luis potosi (mexico). during the year under report, the volume of waste for disposal per ve produced decreased by 18.6 % to 3.33 kg compared to 2019. the main reason for differ- ences in the volume of waste for disposal is changes in the structure of the existing waste disposal companies at the bmw group's various locations. for example, in 2020 the shenyang plant in china began using house- hold-type commercial waste to generate energy, a strategy also introduced at the rosslyn plant in south africa. waste for disposal per ve produced the bmw group reduced its emissions of volatile organic compounds ((cid:57)oc (cid:231)) per ve produced by 4.7 % to 0.81 kg in the 2020 reporting period. this year- on-year improvement is attributable to process optimi- sations such as restricting the quantity of material used for cleaning work, the use of solvent-free cleaning agents, and the equipping of several new paint shops with ex- tended thermal oxidisation facilities for base and clear coats, such as at the munich, dingolfing and shenyang plants. solvent emissions per ve produced gri 305-7 at 2.25 m(cid:231) per ve produced, specific water consumption dropped by 3 % compared to the

load man- agement, for example by reducing standby consumption during shift breaks. in order to reduce water consump- tion, the bmw group's plants are further improving their circulation systems by means of wastewater treatment. - 38 % energy consumption per ve produced since 2006 monitoring resource consumption the monitoring of resource consumption is an in- tegral part of the group's environmental management strategy in the global production network and is man- aged by the steering committee of the bmw group's international environmental protection network. each facility, building and space at each location is allocated to an internal operator. within this area, the operator is not only responsible for the facilities and technical systems as well as the smooth running of processes and procedures, but also for their environmental impact. (cid:640) an environmental management system in accord- ance with has been implemented at all 31 bmw group production plants. with the exception of the manaus plant in brazil (planned for 2021), all group sites are certified according to this standard. the five competence centres - emissions, water, waste, qualification and environmental management system - coordinate the bmw group's environmental protec- tion measures worldwide. accordingly, any ecological improvements that have proven to be effective at one location are implemented at other locations to the extent possible. ongoing further training and the exchange of information between employees are aimed at ensuring the transfer of knowledge. 1 efficiency indicator calculated from electricity, heat, natural gas and heating oil consumption from ve production ( without motorcycles) minus chp losses, divided by the total number of ves produced, ex- cluding ves from the magna steyr and nedcar contract production plants, plus energy consumption of the engine plants and electric engines as well as battery production, divided by engine production in hams hall, steyr, munich and bmw brilliance automotive ltd. in shenyang. 2 the figures for 2016 to 2018 were examined by the external auditor on the basis of a limited assurance engagement. 3 voc emissions (volatile organic compounds) are generated in particular during the painting process and can be reduced by deploying innovative painting technologies. 4 each operator is required to describe the environmental impacts in the aspect register in accordance with the environmental management system and identify measures for improvement (-term targets). bmw group combined management report report 2020 production, purchasing and supplier network 98 circular economy maximises resource efficiency and contributes to climate protection the responsible use of resources plays a key role in the bmw group's business model. for example, if electric mobility is not only to be produced using pri- mary materials in the long term, the underlying flows of resources need to undergo a sustainable transforma- tion. the bmw group intends to create high-quality secondary raw materials by promoting a greater degree of transparency in the recycling chain and tracking the actual further use of raw materials within the cycle. the group wants to provide effective impetus for a circular economy that is viable in the long term by emphasising the importance of recycling valuable resources. at the same time, this strategy can significantly contribute to cutting carbon emissions (scope 3 upstream), as the use of secondary raw materials can significantly reduce the size of the group's carbon footprint in its procurement and production processes - even down to as little as one-sixth, depending on the material. for this reason, the bmw group has defined the circular economy as a strategic focus for the coming years. this includes its own internal initiatives as well as increasing its external commitment in dialogue with major stakeholders. the economical use of resources is already a key re- quirement in the design process and at the product devel- opment stage and guarantees that bmw group products are designed to ensure that as much raw material as possible remains within the circular economy. in 2020, a total of 99.1 % of the waste generated in production processes was either recycled or recovered. to the extent viable, depending on the waste disposal market and distances to the supplier, the cycles of materials are phys- ically closed so that the resulting recyclates can be reused. end-of-life ves are therefore not considered as waste to be disposed of, but as a source of secondary raw ma- terials. for this reason, the bmw group promotes the return of end-of-life ves, components and materials to the raw materials cycle. together with its sales organi- sations in each country, the group has already organised the taking back of end-of-life ves in 30 countries and offers environmentally friendly recycling services at more than 2,800 take-back centres. all ves brought onto the market since 2008 comply with global requirements for the recycling of end-of-life ves, components and materials. already today, ves are required to be 95 % recyclable. gri 301-3 by 2030, the bmw group intends to further increase the percentage of recycled secondary raw materials in its ves while systematically developing the recy- cling process at the same time. during the year under report, around 25 % of the steel and up to 20 % of the thermoplastics the group used for ve manufacturing were derived from secondary sources. up to 50 % of the aluminium the bmw group uses to make its aluminium castings comes from secondary sources. average distribu- tion of materials in bmw group ves gri 301-2 in its efforts to minimise waste, the bmw group has developed recycling and reprocessing concepts that are adapted to the waste flows in its various plants, to region- al legal requirements and to existing local waste disposal structures. moreover, the group intends to increase its level of expertise in the development and production of battery cells electric mobility and create greater transpar- ency regarding the whereabouts and recycling of end-of- life ves and their resources. input / output assessment through its own venture capital fund bmw i ven- tures, the bmw group has invested in key technologies that can make a decisive contribution towards achieving its long-term vision of carbon neutrality. in 2020, for ex- ample, bmw i ventures invested in purecycle, the first company in the world that can recycle polypropylene (an essential ve component) into a colourless and odourless native state. the bmw group also invested in prometheus fuels, which has developed a technology that enables carbon-neutral synthetic fuels to be pro- duced using green energy. (cid:47)ogistics(cid:29) freight carriers and car(cid:69)on emissions in close cooperation with freight carriers, infrastructure oper- ators and commercial ve manufacturers, the bmw group is developing ecologically sustainable logistics concepts. the green logistics strategy pursues the logistical aim of achiev- ing climate-neutral transportation, thereby contributing to the group's target of reducing carbon emissions in the supply chain by 20 % per ve by 2030 (base year 2019). the carbon footprint and the use of carbon-efficient energy and modes of transport is a decisive criterion for the bmw group when selecting freight carriers. currently, more than half of the ves the group produces are transported from manufactur- ing plants by rail. when supplying ves to the chinese mar- ket, the bmw group is further reducing its carbon footprint by using the railway lines along the silk road more intensively. in or- der to reduce carbon emissions, some of the spare parts sent to china by airfreight are being increasingly dispatched by rail. for other overseas markets, the option to switch to intermodal air-sea transport has been tested. the bmw group is increasingly working on the further devel- opment and piloting as well as the use of innovative technolo- gies and already deploys battery- and gas-driven trucks to sup- ply production facilities. in 2020, the bmw group used the sea route from belgium to spain for ve production purposes. the use of biofuel from waste cooking oil led to a reduction in carbon emissions of 1,100 t. bmw group combined management

electricity, energy generated from renewable sources (). with the aim of cutting the carbon emissions it generates in production processes by an additional 80 % per ve by 2030 (base year 2019) in a further step, the bmw group systematically continues to invest in optimising the energy efficiency of its global production network. the strategy includes the use of process heat in paint shops and data analysis to reduce the power consumption of its machinery to a minimum. moreover, the bmw group is further ex- panding its own renewable power generation capacities at its various locations and increasing its energy storage capability. leveraging these and other measures, the group is making steady progress towards its long-term goal of becoming a leader in the use of renewable energy in production and value creation. renewable energy generated in-house the bmw group is reducing the size of its carbon footprint by generating its own electricity from renewable sources. it is utilising suitable technologies and develop- ing solutions, depending on the location and the on-site conditions. the various options range from solar energy, for example in mexico, to biogas in south africa and wind power in leipzig. as the bmw group's in-house production cannot fully cover its energy requirements, it 99 buys in electricity from renewable sources - preferably locally. at the same time, in future the bmw group intends to cover an increasing percentage of its elec- tricity requirements through so-called power purchase agreements (ppas), direct purchases from defined renewable energy generation facilities. the group is also working on solutions for storing renewable energy. for example, the storage farm at the bmw group plant in leipzig is equipped with high-volt- age batteries from the bmw i3 (cid:230). the storage farm is in- tegrated in the public power grid and provides control energy, which means the bmw group is additionally helping to keep the public electricity grids stable. clear processes, roles and responsibilities independent processes have been established throughout the company for planning and implementing energy-related measures, which assign clear roles and responsibilities to the central strategy departments, the regional controlling offices and the plants at local level. the bmw group also maintains a close dialogue with its energy suppliers in local markets, monitors regulatory developments and calls in external support as needed in order to respond to any changes in the percentage of renewable electricity supplied and the size of its carbon footprint. share of green electricity purchased from third parties 3, 4 in % % green electricity from renewable sources 1 electricity from in-house renewable generation plants, direct supply

supplier network purchasing and supplier network the bmw group has laid the foundations for a stable and sustainable supply chain by organising its purchasing processes, managing international supply relationships with its partners and producing its own components. the purchasing and supplier network therefore makes a significant contribution to the group's focus on the strategic markets of tomorrow, such as e-mobility and connectivity, and takes steps to ensure correspond- ing production volumes in the supply chain. with the growing demand for electrified ves, the need for the respective components and parts in production is also in- creasing. for battery cells in particular, the bmw group is taking a variety of measures to accommodate this growth. for example, it will purchase the battery cells for its entire fifth generation from four different sup- pliers, thus making itself less dependent on individual manufacturers. flexibility in terms of volume is both a premise and a decisive criterion for selecting battery cell suppliers. the purchasing and supplier network has been op- erating on a global basis for many years and adheres to the principle of procuring parts and components locally. the bmw group has efficient teams on the ground in all of its key purchasing markets. direct contact with these local markets has proved particularly effective during the coronavirus pandemic. despite the high level of pressure on the supply chain, the bmw group again managed to ensure a seamless supply of parts to its globally located production plants throughout the 2020 reporting year. the supply chain has thus demonstrated its stability and flexibility, despite the exceptional conditions witnessed in the 2020 pandemic year. its many years of sustainable activity in the purchasing and supplier network have also helped to build this resilience. overall, the purchasing and supplier network is responsible for the global procurement and quality as- surance of production materials, raw materials, capital goods and services as well as the in-house manufacturing of ve components. external suppliers are rigorously selected on the basis of competitiveness in terms of op- erational excellence, quality, innovation, flexibility, cost and sustainability. 100 regional distribution of bmw group purchase volumes * in EUR billion asia /

sustainability integral to purchasing and supplier network new targets for decarbonisation in the supplier network motivating partners to operate sustainably the bmw group places great emphasis on cor- porate due diligence. the group already addressed this issue in 2008, defining and setting out comprehensive environmental and social standards for the awarding of contracts for the bmw i3. since 2010, the bmw group has required its partners and suppliers for bmw i models to comply with human rights and extended environ- mental and social standards, including environmental protection management systems. since 2014, these speci- fications have been mandatory for suppliers of all ve models. in 2019, this requirement was supplemented to include occupational health and safety management systems wherever necessary. for many raw materials, the requirement to ensure that environmental standards and human rights have not been violated poses a particular challenge, for instance in the case of lithium and cobalt, both of which are key raw materials for manufacturing battery cells. by the year 2030, the bmw group intends to have over seven million electrified ves on the road. this means that the average carbon emissions generated by the bmw group's supplier network (scope 3 upstream according to sbti) will increase by more than one-third per ve by 2030 if no countermeasures are taken. apart from the growing percentage of electrified models in the bmw group's product range, the reasons are, for example, the energy-intensive production of battery cells, the greater use of aluminium and increased localisation in china, where the proportion of green electricity in the energy mix is still relatively low. nevertheless, the bmw group has set itself the goal of not only halting this trend, but even reversing it and reducing carbon emis- sions per ve in the supply chain () by at least 20 () (cid:230) (base year 2019) by 2030. with this aim in mind, among other measures, since 2020 it has established the carbon footprint as a criterion for awarding contracts within the supply chain. the bmw group is continuously expanding its sus- tainability activities across the supplier network. the fo- cus is essentially on three key issues: 1. decarbonisation, 2. compliance with environmental and social standards, particularly human rights, and 3. the protection of nat- ural resources. one of the biggest levers for promoting decarboni- sation in the supply chain is the use of green electricity. for this reason, the bmw group has agreed with the suppliers of the current fifth generation of battery cells to use only green electricity from renewable sources for production purposes. just as the bmw group continuously implements optimisation and efficiency measures in its own pro- duction environment, it is also actively committed to promoting decarbonisation measures within its supplier network. by participating in the cdp supply chain pro- gramme, the group motivates its suppliers to operate sustainably and, for example, utilise renewable energy in their production activities. the core of the programme consists of annual reporting that takes a multitude of climate-related aspects into account, including specific measures to reduce carbon emissions or increase the per- centage of renewable energy deployed. the bmw group strongly encourages its suppliers to set targets in line with the paris climate agreement and thereby contrib- ute to limiting global warming. the group's success is reflected in the steadily growing number of suppliers participating: 63 suppliers (2019: 40) reported at least one 2-degree-compliant target system, and 59 (2019: 54) plan to publish one within the next two years. at least - 20 % co2 emissions per ves in the supply chain by 2030 1 including transport logistics. 2 value rounded for simplification purposes. the target percentage validated in conjunction with sbti is 22 %. bmw group combined management report report 2020 production, purchasing and supplier network 102 in 2020, a total of 218 suppliers to the bmw group (2019: 199) reported via the cdp supply chain pro- gramme, accounting for approximately 79 % of the bmw group's production-related purchasing volume (2019: 78 %). the participating suppliers reported carbon reduction totalling some 22 million tonnes of emissions (2019: 32 million tonnes), which are proportionately attributable to the materials and goods supplied to the bmw group. due to the coronavirus pandemic and the re- sulting decrease in production volumes, carbon emissions were generally lower in 2020. accordingly, the reduction in reported carbon emissions was also lower. gri 308-1, 308-2, 414-1, 414-2 the bmw group has integrated the assessments of the cdp supply chain programme in its key purchasing processes. the results are used in discussions with sup- pliers, in strategic management meetings and in overall supplier strategies to point out potential for improvement. on average, suppliers that have been reporting within the cdp supply chain programme for at least three years have improved. the bmw group sees this fact as proof that the programme has become well established at the companies participating for longer periods and that it yields the intended results. in 2020, the group also asked more than 1,000 additional suppliers who, as small and medium-sized companies, did not meet the criteria to be invited to the cdp supply chain programme to complete a carbon-related questionnaire. the activity further cov- ered approximately another 11 % (and therefore a total of 90 %) of the group's production-related purchasing vol- ume. the results of the survey provided the bmw group with additional insights that enabled it to further establish the carbon footprint assessment in the supply chain as an award criterion in decision-making processes. this was already the case in 18 out of 31 tenders with the largest carbon footprint. gri 308-1, 308-2, 414-1, 414-2 respect for environmental and social standards and human rights key elements for sustainable materials purchasing it is a major challenge to ensure compliance with human rights as well as environmental, health and safe- ty standards in the extraction of raw materials. for this reason, bmw group purchasing goes beyond the mere contractual agreement of sustainability standards to a deeper point in the supply chain in order to conclude respective direct agreements at particularly critical points in the supplier network and ensures compliance with them by conducting audits. the bmw group is also involved in various initia- tives to standardise management approaches towards implementing human rights due diligence and applying them throughout the entire supplier network. in ger- many, for example, these include the industry dialogue on respect for human rights along the global supply and value chains of the german automotive industry, in which the bmw group is actively involved. it is also active internationally and involved in initiatives to stand- ardise the mining of raw materials. by certifying mines in accordance with the standards of the responsible mining assurance (irma) or the aluminium stewardship initiative (asi), the bmw group is promoting compliance with environmental and social standards right from the raw material extraction stage with the aim of making a significant contribution to improving compliance with human rights throughout international supply chains. initiative for during the year under report, the bmw group included key sustainability issues such as biodiversity, deforestation and animal welfare in its supplier sustain- ability policy, which forms the basis for the group's terms and conditions of purchase. accordingly, bmw group suppliers and all purchases are subject to the group's comprehensive sustainability requirements. in 2012, in its materials strategy the bmw group identified particularly critical raw materials and other materials from a sustainability perspective and initiat- ed the cross-industry study material change report (2018) on this basis. the group continuously analyses the raw materials prioritised in the report as well as other materials essential for production with regard to their impact on the environment and society along the entire supply chain. by sourcing raw materials such as cobalt and lithium directly, the bmw group can establish trace- ability and transparency with regard to environmental and social standards, which is critical for conducting due diligence in raw materials supply chains. bmw group combined management report report 2020 production, purchasing and supplier network 103 responsible use of natural resources comprehensive measures and cooperation in a spirit of partnership ensure compliance with sustainability standards. in addition to compliance with environmental and social standards and respect for human rights, the responsible use of nature's finite resources also plays a major role. with the aim of protecting stocks of critical raw ma- terials, by 2030 the bmw group plans to significantly increase the percentage of recycled raw materials, secondary raw materials, that it uses and to reuse these materials in line with circular economy principles. the growth of e-mobility is causing the topic of circular economy to become increasingly important, as a variety of critical raw materials are required to produce battery cells. the use of secondary raw materials significantly reduces the carbon footprint compared to primary ma- terials: by a factor of 4 to 6 for aluminium and by a factor of 2 to 5 for steel and thermoplastics. at its own plants, the bmw group is gradually es- tablishing closed recycling loops between the plants and the raw materials manufacturers, such as at the landshut components plant. in late 2019, the foundry in landshut was certified by the aluminium stewardship initiative (asi) for its sustainable use of aluminium. around half of the aluminium used at the bmw group's landshut plant comes from a closed recycling loop. the group is consciously reducing the use of carbon-intensive primary aluminium via this method. we can only succeed in achieving our sustainabil- ity goals by interacting with suppliers on the basis of mutual cooperation. ultimately, climate protection and compliance with environmental and social standards are a challenge for the whole of society. as with quality, sustainability is all about accomplishing ambitious goals in close collaboration with the supplier network. with the aim of stepping up its efforts to ensure due diligence in the field of sustainability, since 2018 the bmw group has been involved in developing the automotive sustainability assessment (asa) in the german association of the automotive industry (vda). based on these guidelines, the performance of essential due diligence procedures can now be audited in a stand- ardised manner, even at the premises of medium-sized suppliers to the automotive industry. the bmw group already applies the responsible business alliance (rba) audit programme for major suppliers from the electronics industry. it also carries out qualification, standardisation and empowerment measures and holds informational events, particularly in the case of supply chains exposed to a higher degree of risk. the aim is to further develop and actively bring about transformation at suppliers with regard to sustainability issues. in its efforts to achieve this aim, the bmw group leverages both individual and standardised elements of the drive sustainability initiative and the responsible business alliance to integrate sustainability in business processes such as procurement. electric mobility can only be sustainable if the raw materials it requires are also obtained as sustainably as possible. take lithium for example: the bmw group currently sources lithium for its fifth genera- tion of high-voltage batteries exclusively from australia, where the material is extracted by means of a so-called hard rock min- ing process. furthermore, the group has commissioned a study on sustaina- ble lithium mining under the auspices of two renowned american universities in order to scientifically investigate water consump- tion in the extraction of lithium. the purpose of the study, which will be jointly conducted by the university of alaska-anchorage and the university of massachusetts-amherst, is to investigate the impact of lithium mining on local water supplies in latin america. lithium is the lightest metal on earth and is mainly used to pro- duce batteries, ceramics, glass and aluminium. it is therefore also an essential material for producing lithium-ion batteries and plays a key role in ve electrification. two-thirds of the world's lithium reserves are located in latin america. to date, however, the impact of lithium mining in the re- gion has not been sufficiently scientifically studied. the gap will now be closed by the study commissioned by the bmw group. basf se is also partially financing the study. bmw group combined management report report 2020 production, purchasing and supplier network 104 in 2020, responsibility for sustainability in the supply chain and also energy was combined in a separate depart- ment within purchasing. it comprehensively manages the integration of sustainability factors in the bmw group's procurement activities. at the same time, it works togeth- er closely with the strategy department and continually adapts operational purchasing requirements. a detailed presentation of sustainability-related activities undertaken in the supplier network and a description of the oecd due diligence guidance is bmw group website. available on the via the due diligence process, the bmw group checks whether and how sustainability standards are be- ing implemented by its suppliers. suppliers contractually undertake to comply with a range of requirements in line with their environmental (, emas) and occu- pational health and safety management systems (ohsas 18001, 45001) and to demand and maintain compli- ance with these agreements from their subcontractors. in 2020, the sustainability questionnaire for sup- pliers, which was initiated by the bmw group in 2012 and jointly compiled by the automotive manufacturers, was comprehensively revised. the bmw group's supply chain response team processes any information regard- ing potential breaches of its sustainability standards in the supplier network. furthermore, the bmw group's human rights supply chain serves as the cen- tral point of contact and can be reached anonymously by telephone or email to report any potential violations of social or environmental standards by suppliers. the bmw group has agreed corrective measures with 64 % (2019: 62 %) of the suppliers at which sustainability shortfalls were identified in the course of the reporting year. the suppliers are required to remedy these defi- cits prior to the start of production. the main areas to be acted upon in particular were hazardous materials management, waste management, working conditions and occupational health and safety. gri 308-1, 308-2, 414-1, 414-2 the bmw group follows the principle of empowerment before disengagement. the mining of cobalt entails risks, particularly when it comes to upholding human rights. the bmw group is committed to en- suring that the mining and processing of cobalt are carried out in accordance with sustainability standards and international- ly applicable labour laws. for this reason, the group purchases the cobalt needed to produce its fifth generation of battery cells directly from the mines themselves and makes it available to the battery cell suppliers. around one-fifth of the bmw group's co- balt requirement is purchased from mines in morocco and the re- maining four-fifths in australia. at the same time, the group is engaged in a pilot project in the democratic republic of congo in keeping with the princi- ple of \"empowerment before disengagement\". in 2018, the bmw group joined forces with other partners to initiate the cross-sector initiative \"cobalt for development\" with the aim of improving the working and living conditions of workers engaged in small-scale cobalt mining operations in the congo. as part of the project, around 40 members of 12 mining cooperatives were trained as trainers on occupational and environmental risks who pass on the content to more than 1,500 miners in the form of training courses. these programmes are underpinned by activi- ties in local communities by which the residents benefit from i am- proved access to education and alternative income opportunities. the project is being implemented by the gesellschaft fur interna- tionale zusammenarbeit (giz) gmbh. the aim of the project is to further develop and professionalise artisanal mining in the congo to meet the bmw group's strict sustainability requirements and could be an option for sourcing cobalt in the long term. more information on this project

them, we also need this kind of diversity among our employees. the bmw group also sets itself targets - for example, for the percentage of women in management. how can these goals be achieved? we identify female talents at the com- pany and develop them selectively. at the same time, we continue to bring qualified women into the company. we already make sure we have a high percentage of women in our talent development pro- grammes. what about other diversity factors? we have expanded our diversity strategy to include physical and mental ability, sexual orientation and identity, in addition

employer offering highly interesting future-oriented jobs, the bmw group is look- ing to recruit new employees, deploy them in the best way possible and specifically promote their potential with the aim of ensuring their long-term employability. the success of this approach is reflected not only in the results of employee satisfaction surveys, but also in the awards the bmw group has received as an attractive employer. employee development and employer attractiveness - key aspects of sustainability promoting and developing the potential of its work- force and being an attractive employer are important aspects of sustainability for the bmw group. and, as one of the most important stakeholder groups, it is log- ical to consistently involve employees in the dialogue when changing the group's

restructur- ing competences, ensuring that vacancies are filled and employees are qualified in good time. 1 training and further education encompasses bmw group vocational training in 11 countries and further education for employees and temp workers of the bmw group in the consolidated companies worldwide. 2 unlike the conventional management career with its focus on disciplinary leadership, the expert career pro- gramme focuses on technical-, project- or company-related topics that do not entail line responsibility for others. this expert career option enables the bmw group to offer employees an additional career path. EUR 279 million spending on employee training and development investment and training bolster job security as one of the pioneers in this field, the bmw group is also shaping the transformation to electric mobility and digitalisation. for example, it already commissioned its autonomous driving campus in unterschleissheim near munich back in 2018 and its battery cell competence centre in munich in 2019. by 2026, the group intends to invest some EUR400 million in a new ve assembly line on the site of the current internal combustion engine production facility at its main plant in munich. the transformation of production sites and long-term job security thus go hand in hand. employees are trained and qualified in order to take on new responsibilities in other areas. for example, the bmw group is further expanding its e-drivetrain production competence centre in dingolfing. it has also established production facili- ties for battery modules and high-voltage batteries at its leipzig and regensburg plants, which are scheduled to begin production in 2021. since 2009, the bmw group has provided more than 52,000 people, not only its own employees, but also those of suppliers, with further training in the field of electric mobility. gri 404-2 development and further training for managers excellent leadership is a vital prerequisite for deliv- ering outstanding performance in a competitive envi- ronment. the bmw group's managers play a key role in implementing its new corporate strategy. in order to develop this expertise, the bmw group promotes per- sonalities who have the right attitude and individual, context-related behaviour, joint team leadership skills and a high degree of connectedness within the company. apart from careers in management, the bmw group also offers the expert career (cid:230). it empowers its managers to develop excellent leadership qualities based on a uniform understanding of leadership. gri 404-2 future orientation and innovative capability with fiz future the technological heart of the bmw group beats in its research and innovation centre (fiz). with the fiz future programme, the bmw group is combining its knowledge, expertise and creativity at its location in munich (germany) in order to research and devel- op the individual mobility of the future, characterised by electrifica- tion, digitalisation and connectivity. the opening of the fiz nord project building was a major milestone in the year under report. at the new fiz nord, the bmw group is pooling the innovative strength and key competences it will need to take on the challenges of the future. for the first time, all its ve- drivetrain developers are working under one roof - on both state-of-the-art, highly efficient petrol engines and the latest gen- eration of electric drivetrains. the key aim here is to promote in- tensive collaboration and thus also the transfer of knowledge be- tween the various technologies. with this strategy, the bmw group has taken an important step towards developing the competences and networking of the people who work there as well as bolstering its innovative strength. bmw group combined management report report 2020 employees and society 111 promoting young talent vocational training at the bmw group makes an important contribution to meeting the constant demand for young talent within the company, thus underlining the attractiveness of the group as an employer. at the same time, the group has the ambition to develop per- sonalities through vocational training and enable young people to participate in society. with this point in mind, the bmw group invests in vocational training and thus in the skilled workers of tomorrow. despite the chal- lenges posed by the pandemic, the bmw group again recruited 1,200 trainees in germany alone during the year under report. this social responsibility still includes the promise that bmw ag will offer its trainees perma- nent positions after completing their vocational training at its various plants and at the company headquarters. for several years now, the bmw group has been additionally investing in digitalised training, which has been even more widely used since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. innovative learning platforms and formats as well as digitalised learning content ensured that numerous training locations were able to continue offering training with virtually no gaps, even when the vocational schools were closed. trainees are preparing for their future occupations in 30 skilled trades and 1() dual courses of study at 19 training locations around the world. the training oppor- tunities on offer are geared towards the group's future fields of activity. graduate trainees thus play a key role in developing expertise within the bmw group. gri 404-2 the bmw group attracts further young talents by offering academic programmes for junior staff and supports them in their professional and personal de- velopment through mentoring, networking and a wide range of qualification opportunities in practical and international assignments. despite the coronavirus pan- demic, the bmw group managed to implement all of its programmes. face-to-face events were partially replaced by digital formats and the international assignments that form part of the global (cid:47)eader development programme () were largely conducted at bmw ag level, despite the un- favourable conditions. the total number of apprentices and trainees participating in development programmes for junior staff within the bmw group remained at the high level of 4,6()2 in the year under report (2019: 4,801(cid:30) - 2.() ()). apprentices and participants in young talent programmes 2 number 5,000 4,500 4,000 4,964 4,750

therefore the world's top-ranked automotive manufacturer in the current rank- ing of the world's most attractive employers 2020 as rated by the well-known study provider universum. in the study - which counts as one of the leading studies in the field of employer attractiveness worldwide - the bmw group ranked fourth among engineering and it students worldwide, after google, microsoft and apple. when conducting the study, universum surveyed 235,000 students from the 12 economically largest na- tions worldwide. this recognition is a major success for the bmw group. in the trendence young professionals barometer for germany, the bmw group again achieved top spot in 2020. as an attractive employer, the bmw group offers fu- ture-oriented jobs and the right conditions for employees to grow personally and contribute towards shaping the future. outstanding performance is a daily motivation to develop individual potential and make the company successful together. universum study top-ranked automotive manufacturer - world's most attractive employers 2020 bmw group combined management report report 2020 employees and society 112 in our efforts to ensure that the bmw group re- mains an attractive employer, we also offer above-average salaries for the respective labour markets. to verify this fact, we conduct remuneration studies each year on a worldwide basis. the total salary package consists of monthly remuneration and a variable component. we also offer a wide range of additional benefits, such as a company pension. gri 401-2 depending on their stage of life or living circum- stances, employees have different needs when it comes to organising their work and their working hours. for this reason and to help employees find a good work-life balance, the bmw group offers a great deal of individual personal scope in the form of working time arrangements such as flexible working hours, remote working, addi- tional holidays in return for a corresponding reduction in salary, sabbaticals or temporary and permanent part-time solutions. these factors form the basis for individually adjusting contractually agreed working hours. the bmw group is also investing in so-called new working environ- ments with the aim of offering employees contemporary and attractive spaces in which to collaborate. every two years, the bmw group conducts a com- pany-wide employee survey. the survey conducted in autumn 2019 again showed a slight improvement in the (cid:43)igh performance index ((cid:43)po-i) compared to 201(). the hpo-i is integrated as a parameter in the bmw group's management system and measures the performance of the organisation as a whole. the results of the 2019 them- ployee survey were evaluated, analysed and internal measures derived accordingly. among other aspects, at- tractiveness as an employer and overall satisfaction were rated with 85 () and 82 () approval respectively. despite overall positive approval ratings with regard to employer attractiveness, a declining trend is discernible, which shows that topics such as climate change, sustainability and electric mobility are becoming increasingly impor- tant for the workforce and thus also for the survey results. the bmw group is responding to this development with its new strategy, focusing on sustainability and numerous internal initiatives, including stakeholder dialogues with employees on the topic of sustainability. the group is also implementing the new strategic guidelines in its various corporate divisions. its assessment regarding processes has also developed highly positively, albeit still at a low level. in order to encourage this positive trend, activities aimed at improving interdisciplinary coopera- tion have been stepped up. the results of the follow-up process were reported to the board of management in july 2020. the next employee survey is currently being prepared and will be conducted in autumn 2021. of personnel measures that reconciled the future viability of the organisation with the interests of the workforce. firstly, the number of employees was reduced through natural fluctuation, and secondly by reaching voluntary agreements such as early retirement part-time working arrangements or direct early retirement. appropriate provisions were recognised and the ex- pected cost included in personnel expenses. for details see note 15 to the group financial statements. employee attrition rate * as a percentage of workforce managing employment and workforce planning as of 31 december 2020, the bmw group employed a total of 120,()26 people worldwide. from the 2020 re- porting period onwards, the figure denoting the size of the workforce only includes core and temporary employ- ees. the number of employees is slightly below that of the previous year (2019: number of employees based on new definition: 126,016(cid:30) - 4.2 ()). gri 102-7, 102-8 the widespread restrictions on public life and the economy caused by the coronavirus pandemic also had a negative impact on the automotive industry in 2020. the bmw group responded by taking a number of personnel measures. initially, it made use of flexible arrangements such as reducing excess hours on time and holiday accounts, followed by the introduction of short-time working hours. in dialogue with the works council, the group also agreed on a balanced package * bmw ag; number of employees on unlimited employment contracts leaving the company. strategic personnel planning serves as a tool for iden- tifying the need to readjust personnel and competence structures at an early stage. the bmw group uses this information as the basis for making targeted improve- ments in the areas of training and further education, personnel development, marketing, recruiting and young talent programmes. bmw group combined management report report 2020 employees and society 113 health and performance health management with a holistic approach the bmw group places great emphasis on main- taining and promoting the health and the performance of its employees. it therefore encourages personal respon- sibility and designs its work environments with the idea of maintaining the health of its people in the long term. in line with this strategy, employees at all bmw group locations have a comprehensive health management sys- tem available to them. the group's very high standards of occupational safety also serve as a preventive measure. since 2011, the bmw group has combined a set of coordinated measures to promote the health and performance of its workforce within its health initiative programme. a range of campaigns inform the workforce on subjects such as addiction prevention or ways of maintaining good mental health. regular campaign days, dialogue events and training courses address current health topics such as nutrition, exercise and fitness, can- cer prevention or mental resilience and raise awareness of these issues accordingly. due to the unprecedented circumstances caused by the pandemic, many of these events took place virtually. gri 403-6 the bmw group greatly emphasises the importance of all of its employees having access to the company's in- house health services. in germany, the focus is mainly on providing acute treatment for employees and temporary workers during working hours. in certain countries, how- ever, the group's health service also takes on primary care tasks, such as in thailand, india or mexico. the bmw group's company doctors also advise employees on individual preventive measures if requested to do so and help them adapt their work environment to ensure that their health and performance are maintained in the long term. gri 403-2, 403-3 measures to address the coronavirus pandemic in terms of health protection for the bmw group's workforce, the exceptional challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic had to be addressed during the year under report. the primary aim was to ensure the group's ability to perform while at the same time pro- tecting the health of its staff. for these reasons, the bmw group set up a crisis management team without delay to draw up and implement effective protection and hygiene concepts. staff and managers were promptly provided with information and recom- mendations for action, not only to protect themselves, but others too. the crisis management team kept a watchful eye on inter- national developments, as the infection spread extremely quick- ly during the year under report. the bmw group responded ef- fectively in a challenging situation that had to be reassessed on a daily basis at times. specially trained teams were sent out to the group's various lo- cations and plants, advising managers and employees on how best to implement the protection and hygiene measures. the ex- perts from the hygiene teams were also available to answer ques- tions at any time. moreover, a group-wide information campaign helped inform employees on how best to contribute to curbing the rate of infection. regular safety and hygiene inspections en- sure that the measures are being implemented effectively and on a sustained basis during the pandemic. the bmw group ensured the health and safety of its entire work- force at its various locations throughout the year under report, despite the exceptional challenge posed by the coronavirus pan- demic. the new sars-cov-2 occupational health and safety reg- ulations were implemented at bmw ag and a works agreement was concluded to that effect. a comprehensive manual based on this agreement is ensuring the implementation of infection con- trol measures worldwide. bmw group combined management report report 2020 employees and society 114 in line with the general demographic change, the increasingly high average age of the workforce presents further challenges in terms of healthcare. the bmw group's health initiative also closely ad- dresses the concerns of employees looking to remain as healthy and productive as possible at an advanced age. gri 403-3, 403-6 one of the parameters the bmw group uses to quan- tify the success of its health management measures is the sickness rate. at 3.4 (), the sickness rate at bmw ag was lower than in the previous year (2019: 5.0 () or 3.() () according to the new definition). gri 403-10 the group continuously strives to improve this figure by means of its health management measures. sickness rate 1 in % gri old 2019 new 2020 occupational safety at all group locations accident frequency rate 2 occupational safety is one of the bmw group's fore- most preventive measures for protecting and maintaining the health of its workforce. the strategy is based on a comprehensive management system that not only meets legal requirements applicable at the group's various lo- cations, but frequently goes beyond them. accordingly, the bmw group is committed to ensuring and certifying the highest level of occupational safety at all its locations. the right to occupational health and safety is also a key feature enshrined in the bmw group's code on human rights and working conditions. in the code, the com- pany undertakes to consistently comply with currently applicable occupational health and safety legislation worldwide and also to set its own additional standards for improving occupational safety. gri 403-1 fortunately, in 2020 the accident frequency rate across the workforce as a whole dropped further to 3.2 accidents per 1 million hours worked (2019: 3.5). however, one fatal accident occurred at the group's dingolfing plant during the year under report. by 2015, the bmw group had already achieved the target it set itself in 2011 of halving the accident frequency rate to 4.5 accidents per 1 million hours worked by 2020. since then, the bmw group has endeavoured to continue reducing this rate. gri gri ,092 or 99.() () of people employed at bmw group plants work at a

work safely at bmw group locations. for this reason, cooperation with contractual partners is regulated in a separate contractor declaration, enabling potential hazards to be identified and appropriate protec- tive measures taken on this basis. on large construction sites, all employees of external companies are given safety briefings by bmw group experts. on smaller construction sites, however, this duty is performed by the contractors themselves. the company department responsible for placing the order monitors compliance with the occupational health and safety regulations, sup- ported by the relevant occupational health and safety unit as required. in order to improve occupational safety at the up- stream stages of the value chain, too, the bmw group requires its suppliers to comply with internationally recognised occupational health and safety requirements () via its purchasing conditions. gri 403-7 management, training and quality assurance all topics relating to health and occupational safety within the bmw group are combined in the work en- vironment, health, group safety and group data pro- tection unit and allocated to the board of management's human resources area of responsibility. moreover, the managers in the various specialist departments are responsible for all related in-house processes. health management and occupational safety, occupational health professionals, occupational medical staff, safety specialists and safety officers support and advise the respective internal departments. gri 403-1 the bmw group continually assesses and improves occupational health and safety at all its locations based on recognised management systems such as 45001, o(cid:43)sas 18001 or o(cid:43)ris (cid:230), via occupational health and safety committees and by way of in-house risk assessments. health and safety committees that include both employer and employee representatives work actively at nearly all bmw group locations, making continuous improvements to occupational health and safety standards. gri 403-4 the group ensures the quality of its processes by conducting internal audits on an annual basis. tests at the bmw group's various locations are performed by external certification organisations and the specialists re- sponsible for implementation are given regular training. due to the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandem- ic, in order to comply with safety and hygiene regulations, audits were conducted partly on-site and partly virtually in the year under report. gri 403-2, 403-4, 403-9, 403-10 in order to identify work-related risks in both pro- duction facilities and offices, the bmw group conducts wide-ranging risk and stress analyses. for example, during the year under report, the internal analysis of an industrial accident uncovered a risk in the produc- tion of high-voltage batteries. a technical solution was then found to automate this stage of production. the employees concerned were then trained and instructed and their protective equipment was adapted accordingly. a specific risk assessment was also carried out pertaining to the coronavirus pandemic. employees are encouraged to contact their managers at any time if hazards or risks are identified. employees can also approach their des- ignated work representative at any time, or report risks and hazards anonymously via the compliance hotline. gri 403-2 on the basis of management systems, the bmw group regularly evaluates all the methods and instruments used within the company. the results are then used to improve internal standards. as part of its co-determination process, the bmw group involves the works council as well as representatives of the severely disabled and personnel management as required. to ensure occupational health and safety standards at all its locations, the bmw group provides its staff with regular training. the bmw group academy is solely responsible for all training measures relating to environmental protection and occupational health and safety. it prepares its various seminars in cooperation with the relevant departments for occupational safety, ergonomics, environmental protection and health man- agement. however, the occupational safety, ergonomics and environmental protection departments or the health services can also develop and offer their own measures if required to do so at short notice. the bmw group is also adapting these programmes in line with the current pandemic situation and increasingly switching to virtual solutions. gri 403-5 1

diversity at all levels the bmw group sees diversity as a strength and this factor in its workforce is one of the keys to its cor- porate success. the bmw group believes that diversity fosters innovation and therefore also boosts competitive- ness. a deeper understanding of the needs of customers around the world is just one example. in recent years, the bmw group's diversity concept has continued to broaden the eclectic nature of its workforce in terms of gender, cultural background, age and experience. for this reason, the board of management not only approved the group's existing diversity concept, but broadened it during the year under report. the bmw group places great emphasis on an unprej- udiced, appreciative and inclusive working environment for all its employees. to underline its conviction, in 2020 the bmw group continued expanding the diversity concept with the existing dimensions of gender, cultural background, age and experience to include sexual orien- tation and identity as well as disability. the bmw group promotes a culture that sees strength in diversity and difference as a valued asset. it seeks to raise awareness of diversity issues among its employees and managers by means of training, presentations and dialogue formats and also promotes diversity and equal opportunity via its recruiting and personnel development measures. during the year under report, the bmw group again organised an international diversity week with the aim of raising awareness of every dimension of diversity within the company and exerting a positive influence on its corporate culture. however, the programme was conducted exclusively online due to the coronavirus pan- demic. the diversity week and the simultaneously run global diversity awareness campaign were transmitted in a variety of digital formats and reached an approximate total of 92,000 bmw group employees online. the equal treatment of all employees is a funda- mental principle firmly enshrined in group policy. the bmw group code of conduct and the bmw group code of human rights and working conditions rigorously ad- dress discrimination of all kinds. employees are asked to contact their managers, the relevant specialised units, the personnel department or the works council if they have any pertinent concerns. the bmw group speakup line is a telephone service available in over 30 languages that gives employees worldwide the opportunity to report possible violations both anonymously and confidentially. diversity-promoting concepts have also been developed for selecting the future composition of the board of management and the supervisory board. the bmw group provides information on the respective diversity criteria and how to implement them in its corporate governance statement. bmw group combined management report report 2020 employees and society 117 percentage of female employees percentage of women in management positions and in the total workforce of the bmw

valid up to and including 2020. in % entire workforce management positions the percentage of women in management positions () within the bmw group has been rising steadily for many years. globally, the proportion of female managers in the bmw group stood at 1().8 () at the end of : new definition(cid:30) 1().2 ()). at bmw ag, the number of women in management positions has more than doubled

proportion of 1() () to 19 () of women in the total workforce and 19 () to 21 () in man- agement positions. to achieve this target, bmw ag care- fully analysed the effectiveness of its existing measures and programmes during the year under report, focused on specifically optimising them to suit requirements and derived new measures. these include, for exam- ple, new formats for the targeted promotion of young female managers and the option of filling management positions with two people at the same time in a form of joint leadership. in addition, the bmw group ensures a high proportion of women in its young talent promotion programmes and is committed to a seamless return to working life after parental leave. in order to ensure gender pay parity, bmw ag has established a process that compares the monthly pay of men and women based on the categories of full-time, part-time and pay grade. in 2020, there were no signif- icant differences in the total remuneration packages offered to women and men at bmw ag. gri 405-2 the proportion of women in young talent training programmes such as the global leader development programme increased to around : 39 ()) dur- ing the

supported in this respect by its internal network bmw group pride. confirmation of this commitment can be seen, among other things, in the group's top 5 ranking in the dax 30 lgbt+ diversity index 2020. cultural background employees from over 110 countries work together at the bmw group. the ability to work together in inter- national teams in a spirit of trust and respect is key to the group's success. a broad range of opportunities for personnel development, qualification and further training promotes intercultural understanding. for example, the global leader development programme for newly recruit- ed employees is deliberately geared towards international participants. in 2020, new employees from eight countries took part in the programme (2019: 11 countries). with its \"courage to be more open\" campaign, the bmw group is also actively fighting against racism, for an unprejudiced working environment and mutual respect. age and experience the bmw group sees demographic change as both a challenge and an opportunity, as it offers people the chance to combine (life) experience and fresh ideas in a productive way. since 2019, as part of the senior expert programme, retired employees have been passing on their knowledge and experience to their younger colleagues. within the reverse mentoring programme organised by the bmw group, older employees benefit from the new knowledge of the younger generation. managers are qualified to recognise and leverage the opportunities and challenges that mixed-age teams offer. gri 404-2 in % 2018 total 2019 total 2019 total new 1

identities are treated with equal appreciation and respect. with this point in mind, the bmw group is committed, for example, to raising awareness among employees and managers for the concerns of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people, as well as to various cam- paigns as part of the lgbt+ movement's pride month. in the coming years, the bmw group intends to analyse its activities in all five dimensions of the ex- tended diversity concept and add new measures and programmes as the need arises. the human resources policy and strategy department and the operational human resources department, together with the disci- plinary managers, are responsible for all the measures provided for in this concept. bmw group combined management report report 2020 employees and society 119 corporate citizenship building bridges between cultures voluntary commitment of employees corporate citizenship is an integral part of the bmw group's corporate identity. the company's com- mitment to corporate citizenship focuses in particular on long-term and international projects in which it can pro- vide targeted support with its own core competences. at all the group's international locations, this commitment aims at attaining better living conditions, intercultural understanding and good education. support provided during the coronavirus pandemic the coronavirus pandemic posed major challenges for socie- ty and companies worldwide in the year under report. in order to help handle this exceptional situation, the bmw group has orient- ed its measures internationally and focused on its areas of core competence. for example, the bmw group made ves avail- able to social and healthcare facilities. it also donated protective equipment to health authorities and medical facilities. the bmw group aims to play a leading role in inter- cultural understanding. as a corporation with a multi- national workforce and locations on five continents, the bmw group has a keen interest in encouraging tolerance and understanding between various nations, cultures and religions. together with the united nations alliance of civilisations (unaoc), since 2011 the group has regularly presented the intercultural innovation award. the award is designed to promote innovative projects that seek solutions to intercultural tensions and conflicts. originally, the bmw group had set itself the goal of reaching around one million people with the award-win- ning projects by 2020, but it surpassed that figure at an early stage. since 201(), the group has therefore been pursuing the new aim of supporting six million people with the award winners' projects by 2025. by the end of 2020, the award-winning projects had already helped some five million people.* the bmw group therefore believes it is well on the way to exceeding the target it has set itself. * the number of people supported is provided by the award winners at the end of each year. it is calculated based on combined data from media and sources. the figure reported relates only to the people who benefit directly from the projects concerned. the bmw group is increasingly involving its them- ployees in its social commitment efforts. since 2011, the company has presented the bmw group awards for social commitment to its employees. the award goes to staff members who have made a special contribution through their voluntary work. in 2020, five employees were honoured for their charitable social commitment, two of them even received special awards from the dop- pelfeld foundation. the bmw group awards for social commitment are each endowed with EUR 5,000, which go directly to the respective aid projects. this year's award winners come from india (ooruni foundation), germany (gesellschaft fur kinderkrebsforschung e.v. and hilfe fur kinder in kenya) and south africa (gauteng community organization and golden youth club). in addition to the award winners, each of the other five finalists received prize money of EUR 2,500. the organisation waves for water is another project with employee involvement that the bmw group has been successfully working together with for five years. as part of this initiative, employees near the group's locations in mexico, india, thailand and indonesia help provide families with water filters to facilitate their access to clean drinking water. in the year under report, the project was unfortunately interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, but will be continued as soon as permit. bmw group combined management report report 2020 employees and

requirements at its various locations. during the year under report, the bmw group again supported a range of educational projects in the usa, thailand, india, brazil, mexico, china, korea, south africa and germany. however, due to the coro- navirus pandemic, it was unable to offer its support to the same extent as before.() the workshops were there- fore conducted with a smaller number of participants and online whenever possible. the bmw group used any funds that could not be deployed for educational measures due to the coronavirus restrictions to mitigate the immediate consequences

essential to carefully document all the measures in order to ensure that legal requirements are complied with. the bmw group will continue to be socially active on a global basis and focus its commitment on the un sustainable development goals going forward. the joint initiatives of the bmw group and its partners, particular- ly the bmw foundation , therefore focus on the topics in which they can have the greatest impact and benefit society to the greatest extent. inspiring, connecting, investing - the bmw foundation the bmw foundation * is an independent corporate foundation whose activities contribute towards the bmw group's cor- porate citizenship and mission. the foundation's mission is to inspire executives worldwide to take social responsibility and work as respon- sible leaders for a peaceful, just and sustainable future. moreover, the foundation invests in initiatives and organisations that develop solu- tions to social, environmental and political crises. through its responsible leadership programmes, the global respon- sible leaders network and its impact-oriented investments (the eber- hard von kuenheim fund), the bmw foundation has promoted the un sustainable development goals since their adoption in 2015. the digital transformation expedited by the coronavirus pandemic also impacted the foundation's programmes in 2020. for example, the re- sponsible leaders table format events on the topic of europe featuring selected leaders from the worlds of politics, business and civil socie- ty were held virtually. the foundation also conducted the responsible leaders forums that had already been planned for turkey and india on- line. the rise-city programme was carried out in amsterdam, madrid, athens and singapore - either physically or on a hybrid basis - depend- ing on the local situation. the responsible leaders network, which currently has 1,854 members in 109 countries, also maintained its col- laboration via online meetings. in order to actively support the ongoing transformation to a sustainable society and a sustainable economic system, the foundation launched the respond accelerator programme in 2020. for the first group, ten start-ups were selected that aim to successfully develop their sus- tainable business models. respond aims to demonstrate that social responsibility and successful entrepreneurship are not concepts. as part of the five-month programme, which got off to a successful start despite the adverse conditions caused by the pandem- ic, the start-ups received support from mentors and investors from the foundation's network. in response to the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, the bmw foundation supported the german government's (cid:6)wirvsvirus hackathon both financially and via its respond network during the year under report. this world's largest hackathon aims to de- velop creative solutions to combat the impact of the pandemic. further information about the bmw foundation is available here: * the bmw foundation is a corporate foundation of bmw ag. the foundation implements its programme with the income earned on endowment assets or received in the form of regular financial contributions from the benefactor. in accordance with the articles of incorporation, the independent foun- dation is advised by the board of trustees (kuratorium), on which the chairman of the supervisory board and one member of the board of management of bmw ag are represented. bmw group combined management report report 2020 report on economic position 122 report on economic position general and sector- specific environment in 2020, the coronavirus crisis caused the global economy to slump on a scale not seen since the great depression of the 1930s. the international monetary fund (imf) estimates the contraction in global gross domestic product (gdp) at 3.5 (). all g() countries saw a significant drop in economic output. the bric countries also suffered sharp declines - with the notable exception of china. europe's economy was hit harder than any other major region. in the eurozone, the economy contracted sharply by ().6 () year-on-year. significant losses were recorded in germany (- 5.0 ()), france (- 8.3 ()), italy (- 9.0 ()) and spain (- 11.0 ()), the euro(cid:93)one's largest economies. with many areas of the economy complete- ly paralysed at times due to lockdowns lasting several weeks, both production and consumption slumped dramatically. unemployment rates rose in all countries, despite the increases being at least partially held down by short-time work programmes. governments across the region implemented extensive economic stimulus packages to support their countries' economies. the assistance programmes caused government spending to rise sharply in 2020, resulting in higher debt ratios in the respective countries. gdp in the united (cid:46)ingdom (you(cid:46)) slumped by 10.() () in 2020. the performance was influenced not only by the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic, but also by the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the terms of the brexit trade deal, which would ultimately govern the uk's future relations with the european union (eu). in the usa, gdp fell by 3.5 () during the year under report. due to the lockdowns and in the absence of short-time work programmes, the unemployment rate rose significantly. consumer sentiment and exports both slumped during various parts of the year. both corporate investment and industrial production suffered a significant decline. in light of the ensuing economic situation, the us federal reserve (fed) further lowered its benchmark interest rates in 2020. although china was the only economy to expand in 2020, its growth rate of 2.3 () was significantly down on the previous year. consumer demand collapsed almost completely during the spring lockdown. however, strong pent-up demand set in from early summer and lasted through to the end of the year, thereby helping the econ- omy to recover. export-reliant japan also suffered a considerable de- cline in economic output (- 5.3 ()) due to the coronavirus pandemic during the period under report. the main factors here were lower private consumption, particularly in the spring, and the drop in exports. bmw group combined management report report 2020 report on economic

the euro, resulting in an average exchange rate for the year of 122 yen to the euro. the currencies of major emerging markets also lost in value in 2020 as a consequence of the coronavirus crisis. the indian rupee and the russian rouble fell by around 5 () and 14 () respectively against the euro on average, while the real depreciated by as much as 33 () against the euro. bmw group combined

coped well with the major chal- lenges that arose during the pandemic year 2020 and, in view of the pronounced level of volatility on international markets, can look back on a business performance over the last 12 months that can be regarded as satisfactory overall. despite declining key performance indicators in 2020, the bmw group's results of operations, financial position and net assets are indicative of its solid finan- cial condition. overall, business developed in line with management's revised expectations. this assessment also takes into account events after the end of the reporting

also prompted central banks around the world to adopt drastic countermeasures. the aim of their monetary policies was to mitigate the effects of the downturn, for example by making it easier for smaller companies to access cheap credit. in the first half of the year, the european central bank (ecb) decided to increase the existing bond pur- chase programme to EUR 120 billion per month and launch an additional emergency bond purchase programme (pandemic emergency purchase programme - pepp) with a total volume of EUR 1,850 trillion. as a direct response to the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the bank of england (boe) cut its benchmark interest rate in two steps from 0.()5 () to 0.1 () during the first quarter and increased its bond-buy- ing programme to a total volume of 895 billion british pounds. in the usa, in two emergency meetings held during the first quarter, the fed lowered its target range for the benchmark interest rate from between 1.50 and 1.()5 () to between 0.00 and 0.25 (). it also announced further measures, including a commitment to make unlimited bond purchases. after suffering an economic slump at the beginning of the year, but then avoiding a second wave of infec- tions, china recovered earlier and faster than other major economies. instead of introducing massive stimulus pro- grammes, china increasingly relied on other instruments, such as lowering the reserve requirement ratio to 12.5 () and the loan prime rate to 3.85 (). bmw group combined management report report 2020 report on economic position 127 comparn of

the sec that the sec had commenced an inquiry into bmw group's ve sales and sales reporting practic- es. on january 22, 2020, the sec formally opened an investigation into potential violations of you. s. securities laws by bmw group relating to disclosures regarding bmw group's unit sales of new ves. on septem- ber 24, 2020, bmw ag and two of its you. s. subsidiaries settled the matter with the sec and, without admitting or denying the allegations, consented to the entry of an order (the \"sec order\") finding violations of sections 1()(a)(2) and 1()(a)(3) of the you. s. securities act and agreed to pay a penalty of you. s.(cid:7)18 million. the sec order alleged, among other things, that the disclosures that bmw group had provided to investors in its you. s. bond offerings conducted under rule 144a in the period from 2016 to 2019 had contained material misstatements and omissions regarding bmw group's you. s. retail ve deliveries. in connection with the above, bmw group reviewed prior period retail ve delivery data for automo- biles and determined that certain ve deliveries of automobiles were not reported in the correct periods. bmw group has corrected its reported delivery data, as further described below, to report deliveries in the period in which they occurred and has made, and will continue to make in the future, certain adjustments to its poli- cies and procedures (together, the \"revised reporting process\") in order to further improve the reliability and validity of its retail ve delivery data, in particular with respect to the timing of the recognition of retail ve deliveries. bmw group has applied the revised reporting process to all markets with effect from the year 2020. while bmw group revised retail ve delivery data for certain of its most significant markets for the years 2016 through 2019 presented in this report, such data were not revised for bmw group's other markets. as a result, retail ve delivery data presented in this report for the years 2016 through 2019 is not directly comparable to such data presented for the year 2020. specifically, the retail ve delivery data for automobiles presented in this report have been revised as follows: when presenting total retail ve delivery data for automobiles other than model-by-model data, data relating to the years 2016 through 2019 for bmw group's 16 most significant markets were adjusted to reflect the revised reporting process. in the years 2016 through 2019, these 16 markets represented on average approxi- mately 8() () of bmw group's total retail deliveries of au- tomobiles. for each of the years 2016 through 2019, these revisions amounted to less than 1 () of bmw group's total retail deliveries of automobiles. the retail ve delivery data for automobiles for bmw group's other markets have not been adjusted for any period prior to 2020, nor have any retail vehi- cle delivery data for motorcycles been adjusted for any period prior to 2020. bmw group believes the impact on bmw group's retail ve delivery data presented in this report of such data not having been adjusted to reflect the revised reporting process to be immaterial. * see glossary for the definition of deliveries. bmw group combined management report report 2020 report on economic position 129 bmw group believes the retail ve delivery data presented in this report are materially correct in accord- ance with bmw group's current definition and related policies and procedures of retail ve deliveries. retail ve deliveries during a given reporting period do not correlate directly to the revenue that bmw group recognizes in respect of such reporting period. the preparation of bmw group's retail ve deliv- ery data involves a variety of estimates and judgments, some of which are complex and all of which are inher- ently subjective, and is subject to other uncertainties, including: -- the vast majority of deliveries of ves are carried out by independent dealerships or other third parties, and bmw group is reliant on such third parties to correctly report relevant data to bmw group. -- the definition of deliveries includes ves deliv- ered in the united states and canada if the relevant dealers designate such ves as service loaner ves or demonstrator ves. -- retail ve delivery data for periods prior to 2020 include an immaterial number of pre-series ves that were never intended to be sold to end users (such as ves for use by government agencies in connection with safety evaluations (e. g., crash tests) or for other tests). bmw group combined management report

dealership closures, group revenues for the financial year under report were moderately down on the previous year (2020: EUR 98,990 million(cid:30) 2019: EUR 104,210 million(cid:30) - 5.0 ()). negative currency effects caused by the unfavourable development of the us dollar, the russian rouble and the chinese renminbi also had a downward impact on revenues. factors working in the opposite direction included product mix effects due to the less pronounced drop in the sale of high-revenue models, higher selling prices on the back of a rejuvenated product range, and a portfo- lio-related upturn in leasing revenues. positive develop- ments on pre-owned ve markets were reflected in higher revenues generated from the sale of returned lease ves, particularly in the third and fourth quarters. due to the drop in new leasing business in the first half of the year as well as the expected decline in new leasing business in light of lower inventory levels at dealerships, the amount of revenues eliminated on consolidation decreased year-on-year. * group cost of sales amounted to EUR 85,408 million, similar to the previous year's level (2019: EUR 86,14() mil- lion(cid:30) - 0.9 ()).

particularly for the market launch of new ve models such as the bmw 1 series, the bmw 3 series and the x5 - resulted in a year-on-year decrease in cash outflows. proceeds from the sale of marketable securities also had a positive impact on the net cash outflow from investing activities. the net cash outflow from financing activities was mainly attributable to lower financing requirements in the financial services segment and the related reduction in bond issues, the reduced volume of asset-backed fi- nancing and the repayment of liabilities to banks. refinancing a broad range of instruments on international money and capital markets is used to refinance worldwide op- erations. the funds raised are used almost exclusively to refinance the bmw group's financial services business. the overall objective of group financing is to ensure the solvency of the bmw group at all times, focusing on three areas: 1. the ability to act through permanent access to stra- tegically important capital markets 2. autonomy through the diversification of refinancing instruments and investors 3. focus on value through the optimisation of financing costs financing measures undertaken at corporate level ensure access to liquidity for the group's operating sub- sidiaries at standard market conditions and consistent credit terms. funds are acquired in line with a target liability structure, comprising a balanced mix of financ- ing instruments. the use of longer-term instruments to refinance the group's financial services business and the maintenance of a sufficiently high liquidity reserve serves to rule out any imminent liquidity risk for the portfolio. this conservative financial approach also has a favourable effect on the group's rating. further infor- mation is provided in the section \"liquidity risks\" within the \"report on outlook, risks and opportunities\". bmw group combined management report report 2020 report on economic position 135 liquidity-related measures were put in place during the first half of the year to enable the group to respond flexibly to ongoing uncertainties caused by the coronavi- rus pandemic and to manage operations at short notice in the event of possible renewed containment measures. reflecting the improved situation on capital markets in the second half of the year, the bmw group was able to reduce the amount of liquidity on hand to EUR 1().8 billion at 31 december 2020, similar to the previous year's level. the bmw group also has access to a syndicated credit line, which was renegotiated in (cid:45)uly 201(). the syndicated credit line of EUR 8 billion has a term ending in july 2024 and is being made available by a consortium of 44 international banks. the credit line was not being utilised at 31 decem- ber 2020. further information with respect to financial liabilities is provided in notes 31, 35 and 39 to the group financial statements. in 2020, the bmw group issued one euro benchmark bond on the european capital market with a total issue volume of EUR 2.3 billion as well as one bond on the us capital market with a total issue volume of 4.0 billion us dollars. in addition, one bond was issued for a total amount of 0.4 billion british pounds. private placements totalling EUR 3.6 billion were also issued, including so-called \"panda bonds\" for an amount of 6.0 billion chinese renminbi. a total of nine public abs transactions were executed in 2020, including three transactions in china, two in germany and one each in japan, the usa, canada and the uk, with a total financing volume equivalent of EUR 5.8 billion. in addition, further financing equivalent to EUR 10.() billion was realised or secured in the you(cid:46), ger- many, the usa, switzerland and australia via new and prolonged abs conduit transactions. other transactions remain in place in germany, china, the uk, the usa, canada, japan and south africa, amongst others. the following table provides an overview of amounts utilised at 31 december 2020 in connection with the bmw group's money and capital market programmes: programme in EUR billion euro medium term notes australian medium term notes commercial paper * measured at exchange rates at the relevant transaction dates. programme framework amount utilised* bmw group combined management report report 2020 report on economic position 136 net assets of the bmw group bmw group condensed balance sheet at 31 december adjusted for currency effects, the bmw group's balance sheet total was slightly lower than at 31 decem- ber 2019. including currency effects from the us dollar and pound sterling, amongst others, the balance sheet total decreased moderately.

the coronavirus pandemic also affected the bmw group and its dealership organisation. against this backdrop, deliveries () were extremely volatile in 2020. after a promising start to the year, sales figures slumped in the spring, before recovering from the third quarter onwards. during the final months of the year, the bmw group returned to its successful course. in 2020, the bmw group delivered a total of 2,325,1()9 (cid:230) bmw, mini and rolls-royce brand automo- biles to customers (2019: 2,53(),504 (cid:230), (cid:231) units(cid:30) - 8.4 ()), once again leading the premium segment worldwide. due to the impact of the coronavirus crisis in the first half of 2020, deliveries were originally expected to drop significantly over the year as a whole. in the end, however, the decrease was relatively moderate at 8.4 (), largely on the back of a distinct recovery, particularly in the final quarter. 142 deliveries of electrified models 3 in units 2020 2019 change in % bmw group phev

before financial result as a percentage of revenues) came in at : percentage points). as forecast in the quar- terly statement to 30 september 2020, the ebit margin was within the target range of between 0 and 3 () and therefore in line with the revised outlook. in the 2019 annual report, a segment ebit margin within a target range of between 2 and 4 () was forecast. at EUR 560 million, the automotive segment's financial result was significantly up on the previous year (2019: negative EUR 32 million), mainly reflecting the improved result from at-equity accounted investments described in the section on group earnings above. profit before tax for the year amounted to EUR 2,()22 mil- lion and was therefore significantly lower than one year earlier (2019: EUR 4,46() million(cid: ()). the automotive segment's for 2020 was signif- icantly lower at : percentage points). the decline was mainly attributable to the lower ebit. the higher volume of capital expenditure in pre- vious years - including amounts invested to expand the product portfolio - also contributed to this development. as forecast for the financial year 2020, declined significantly and was well below the long-term strategic target valid through 2020 of at least 26 () for the auto- motive segment. automotive segment performance automotive segment revenues amounted to EUR 80,853 million (2019: EUR 91,682 million(cid: (), cur- rency-adjusted: - 10.5 ()) and were therefore significantly lower than one year earlier. lower sales volumes due to the coronavirus pandemic and negative currency effects were partially offset by overall favourable product mix effects brought about by the less pronounced drop in the sale of high-revenue models. improved selling prices also helped to cushion the impact of the drop in revenues. segment cost of sales decreased moderately to EUR ()1,456 million compared to the previous year (2019: EUR ()8,062 million(cid:30) - 8.5 ()). the volume-related decline in cost of sales was offset by expenses for various pro- visions, including those recognised in connection with the exhaust gas recirculation cooler and recalls (such as contaminated battery cells in plug-in hybrid ves). in addition, lower capitalised overhead costs due to the reduction of inventories accounted for at group level as well as higher expenses for depreciation and amorti- sation had the effect of increasing segment cost of sales year-on-year. expenses recognised for workforce measures were largely offset by lower expenses for performance-related remuneration components. the net amount of other operating income and ex- penses improved by EUR 1,361 million, largely due to the provision recognised in relation with the eu commis- sion's ongoing antitrust proceedings in the previous financial year.* * further information is provided in note 10 to the group financial statements. bmw group combined management report report 2020 report on economic position 147 the main factor influencing the decrease in the net cash inflow from operating activities was the pan- demic-related year-on-year deterioration in operational pre-tax earnings. the change in working capital was posi- tively impacted by the reduction in inventories, while the lower level of trade payables - mainly due to an earlier closure of plants - had an offsetting effect compared to the prior year. the decrease in the net cash outflow from investing activities was mainly attributable to the changes described in the group cash flow statement. free cash flow for the automotive segment was as

149 bmw motorrad offers a glimpse into the future motorcycles segment performance in light of the pandemic-related restrictions, bmw motorrad increasingly turned to virtual formats to showcase its new models over the course of 2020. in november 2020, products such as the definition ce04 - an electrically powered scooter featuring innova- tive connectivity solutions for urban mobility - were pre- sented online using a virtual format on the bmw group's innovation platform #nextgen. numerous series models scheduled for launch in 2021 were also presented online, including the m 1000 rr - bmw motorrad's first-ever m model - in september. this was followed in october by the launch of the r18 classic and in november by the launch of the s 1000 r. with the r18 classic, bmw motorrad is expanding its product range in the cruiser segment with the addition of a model that is also ideally suited for touring. revised models of the g 310 gs, the g 310 r and the r 1250 rt were also presented in october and november. motorcycles segment revenues were slightly down year-on-year. the main reasons for this development were the pandemic-related drop in sales and unfavourable currency effects, which were partially offset by positive product mix effects. the segment ebit margin (profit before financial result as a percentage of revenues) came in at : .() percentage points) and thus within the most recently forecast target range of between 3 and 5 (). profit before tax for the year was significantly lower than one year earlier. the for the motorcycles segment in 2020 was 15.0 (), significantly down on the previous year's level (2019: percentage points), mainly due to the lower level of ebit. the performance was in line with the outlook com- municated in the quarterly statement to 30 septem- ber 2020, but well short of the motorcycles segment's target valid through 2020 of 26 (). bmw group combined management report report 2020 report on economic position 150 financial services segment new business with retail customers moderately down on previous year financial services business held down by coronavirus pandemic in a difficult environment dominated by the global impact of the coronavirus pandemic, business devel- oped significantly less favourably for the financial services segment in 2020 compared to one year earlier, a fact reflected in a 24.1 () drop in profit before tax to EUR 1,()25 million (2019: EUR 2,2()2 million). as reported in previous quarters, this development was primarily due to the recognition of risk provisioning expenses for credit and residual value risks, thereby reducing reported earnings over the course of the twelve-month period. due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the segment's total business volume in balance sheet terms decreased moderately by 6.8 () to EUR 133,093 million (2019: EUR 142,834 million). the contract portfolio under management at 31 december 2020 comprised 5,981,928 contracts and was therefore at a similar level to one year earlier (2019: 5,9()3,682 contracts(cid: ()). a total of 1,845,2()1 new credit financing and leasing contracts was signed with retail customers during 2020, a moderate decrease of ().9 () on the previous year (2019: 2,003,()82 contracts). new credit financing contracts also dropped mod- erately by 6.2 (), while new leasing contracts saw a more pronounced decrease of 11.1 (). overall, leasing accounted for 32.9 () and credit financing for 6().1 () of new business. by contrast, customer demand for pre-owned ves picked up in a number of key sales markets including the usa. overall, a total of 405,()13 credit financing and leasing contracts relating to pre-owned bmw and mini brand ves were signed in 2020, a year-on-year improvement of : 398,144 contracts). the total volume of new credit financing and leasing contracts concluded with retail customers during the twelve-month period amounted to EUR 5(),200 million, mod- erately lower than one year earlier (2019: EUR 61,353 mil- lion(cid:30) - 6.8 ()). the share of new bmw group ves leased or fi- nanced by the financial services segment stood at 49.8 () () in 2020, 2.4 percentage points down on the previous year (2019: 52.2 ()), mainly attributable to increased compe- tition in china. the total portfolio of credit financing and leasing con- tracts in place with retail customers edged up year-on- year, rising by 1.9 () to stand at 5,591,()99 contracts at the end of the reporting period (2019: 5,486,319 contracts). china remained the region with the highest growth rate, this time coming in with a moderate year-on-year rise of 8.() (). figures for the europe / middle east / africa region (() 2.6 ()) and the eu bank (cid:230) region (() 2.2 ()) were also up on the previous year. by contrast,

the eu bank comprises bmw bank gmbh and its branches in italy, spain and portugal. the former subsidiary in france was transferred for organisational purposes to the europe / middle east / africa region in conjunction with strategic realignments. dealership financing significantly lower the total volume of dealership financing was sig- nificantly lower compared to one year earlier, falling by 23.5 () to EUR 16,241 million at the end of the reporting period (2019: EUR 21,22() million). 152 as described above, the net cash inflow from operat- ing activities recorded by the financial services segment for the financial year 2020 resulted primarily from the fact that lower ve inventories at dealerships had the effect of reducing receivables from sales financing, mainly in the area of dealership financing. the net cash outflow from financing activities mainly reflected the repayment of loans and the decrease in asset-backed securities financing. bmw group combined management report report 2020 report on economic position return on equity (roe) finished at 11.2 (), slightly below the level achieved one year earlier (2019: percentage points). the decline was primarily attrib- utable to the pandemic-related increase in risk provisions for residual value risks and, to an even greater extent, for credit risks, in both cases causing earnings to deteriorate. the improved risk profile in the fourth quarter, main- ly due to better remarketing outcomes and lower risk provisions for credit losses, contributed greatly to the roe for the full year 2020 being above the forecast value (\"moderate decline\") communicated in the quarterly statement to 30 september 2020. net cash inflows and outflows for the financial ser- vices segment were as follows: financial services segment performance revenues generated by the financial services seg- ment rose slightly to EUR 30,044 million (2019: EUR 29,598 mil- lion(cid:30) 1.5 () currency-adjusted: () 2.9 ()) due to portfolio growth mainly in germany, italy and switzerland as well as due to higher revenues from the sale of returned lease ves. cost of sales relating to financial services business went up by EUR 1,020 million (2019: EUR 25,938 million(cid: ()). apart from depreciation on leased ves and costs associated with the sale of returned lease ves, the increase was driven primarily by additional risk provi- sions related to expected residual value and credit losses. segment profit before tax amounted to EUR 1,()25 mil- lion (2019: EUR 2,2()2 million(cid: ()), significantly down on the previous year. net

the risk profile across the financial services segment's total portfolio was shaped primarily by the volatility arising due to the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting additional risk provisioning measures rec- ognised in connection with expected credit and residual value risks, mainly provisions and allowances to cover future credit and / or residual value losses. the initial and continuous testing of customer cred- itworthiness is an important aspect of the bmw group's credit risk management. as explained in previous quar- ters, for accounting purposes the financial services segment has raised credit loss allowances over the course of 2020 in order to reflect the potential longer-term economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic on retail and dealership business. the amounts recognised were based on reasonable and appropriate market-specific information and estimates available at the end of the reporting period. the credit loss ratio on the total credit portfolio amounted to 0.21 () at 31 december 2020, and was there- fore slightly lower than one year earlier (2019: 0.26 ()). more specifically, the loss ratio stood at 0.: 0.15 ()) for leasing business and 0.: 0.41 ()) for credit financing business with retail customers. the over- all improvement in the loss ratio was also attributable to government measures (such as payment moratoriums or restrictions in the receivables management process) implemented in many countries around the world. in the premium segment for pre-owned ves, remarketing selling prices for ves coming out of leases developed positively overall in 2020. whereas restrictions on sales and the lower supply of new ve- s had a negative impact on demand for new and pre-owned ves during the first lockdown, the market saw an upward trend during the second half of the year. despite this moderate recovery, economic development remains exposed to an increased level of uncertainty due to the pandemic. this point is particularly relevant for the development of prices for pre-owned premium seg- ment ves in the short and medium term. under the prevailing circumstances, the bmw group sees prices as likely to fluctuate significantly in subsequent quarters, as in 2020, due to a number of factors, including possible changes in demand patterns or the renewal of temporary restrictions that could have an impact on the remarketing process. accordingly, in 2020 market-specific risk provi- sioning expenses were recognised relating to the ve portfolio subject to residual value risks. in line with customary business practice, the finan- cial services segment makes provision to take account of significant business risks on an ongoing and compre- hensive basis. based on current assessments, however, the segment has recognised appropriate levels of provi- sions / allowances to cover residual value and credit risks. further information on the segment's risk profile is provided in the section on risks and opportunities and in note 38 to the group financial statements. development of credit loss ratio in % 0. other entities segment / eliminations the combined profit before tax in the other entities segment and eliminations saw a significant improvement of EUR 483 million. this was attributable to reversal effects from the leased products portfolios, lower eliminations due to the decline in new leasing business and the lower expected new leasing business resulting from the reduced levels of inventories at dealerships. bmw group combined management report report 2020 report on economic position comments on financial statements of bmw ag 154 bayerische motoren werke aktiengesellschaft (bmw ag), based in munich, germany, is the parent company of the bmw group. the comments on the bmw group and automotive segment provided in earlier sections apply to bmw ag, unless presented differently in the following section. the financial statements of bmw ag are drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the german commercial code (hgb) and the relevant supplementary provisions contained in the german stock corporation act (aktg). the key financial performance indicator for bmw ag is the dividend payout ratio (unappropriated profit of bmw ag in accordance with hgb in relation to net profit for the year of the bmw group in accordance with ifrs). the key non-financial performance indicators are essentially identical and concurrent with those of the bmw group. these are described in detail in the report on economic position section of the combined management report. differences in accounting treatments based on hgb (used for the company financial statements) and ifrs (used for the group financial statements) are mainly to be found in connection with the capitalisation of intangible assets, the creation of valuation units, the recognition and measurement of financial instruments and provisions as well as the recognition of deferred tax assets. differences also arise in the presentation of assets and liabilities and of items in the income statement. business environment and review of operations the general and sector-specific environment of bmw ag is essentially the same as that of the bmw group and is described in the report on economic position section of the combined management report. bmw ag develops, manufactures and sells automo- biles and motorcycles as well as spare parts and accesso- ries manufactured in-house, by foreign subsidiaries and by external suppliers, and performs services related to these products. sales activities are carried out primarily through branches, subsidiaries, independent dealerships and importers. mainly due to the impact of the coronavi- rus pandemic, automobile deliveries fell by 305,852 units to 2,249,943 units in the financial year 2020. this figure includes 598,853 units relating to series sets supplied to the joint venture bmw brilliance automotive ltd., , an increase of 64,215 units over the previous year. at 31 december 2020, bmw ag employed a work- force of 84,668 people (31 december 2019: 86,()00 people, adjusted). with effect from the financial year 2020, the key performance indicator for the size of the workforce comprises only core and temporary employees. the change in presentation is in line with the change in the internal management system, which now focuses on these employee groups. bmw group combined

research and development expenses other operating income other operating expenses result on investments financial result income taxes profit after income tax other taxes net profit transfer to revenue reserves unappropriated profit available for distribution revenues fell by EUR 9,651 million year-on-year, primar- ily reflecting the lower volume of deliveries to customers caused by the coronavirus pandemic. in geographical terms, the scale of decline was most pronounced in the rest of europe and usa regions. revenues totalled EUR ()5,040 million (2019: EUR 84,691 million), of which group internal revenues accounted for EUR 49,348 million (2019: EUR 5(),412 million) or : 6().8 ()). cost of sales went down by 9.2 () to EUR 63,()26 million, mostly due to the lower number of deliveries. expenses incurred in connection with the exhaust gas recirculation cooler, however, along with a number of other items, had a negative impact in the financial year under report. profit fell by EUR 3,199 million to EUR 11,314 million. overall, selling and general administrative expenses were at a similar level to the previous year. research and development expenses related mainly to new ve models (including the ix3 * as well as the new 4 series coupe and convertible), expenses for the development of reference architectures, drivetrain systems, digital products and automated driving as well as increased expenses in connection with electrification. r(cid:9)d expenses decreased by 2.4 () year-on-year, in line with activities relating to new model start-ups. ,040 - 63,726 11,314 -

income from the reversal of other pro- visions, offset by higher gains on financial transactions. other operating expenses decreased to EUR 1,250 mil- lion (2019: EUR 2,526 million), mainly due to the prior-year recognition of a provision relating to eu commission antitrust proceedings. income from profit transfer agreements with group companies, reported in the line item result on invest- ments, increased year-on-year. by contrast, financial result deteriorated by EUR 319 million, mainly due to lower income from designated plan assets offset against pen- sion obligations. the expense for income taxes related primarily to withholding taxes incurred during the financial year 2020. after deducting the expense for taxes, the compa- ny reports a net profit of EUR 1,()02 million, compared to EUR 2,10() million in the previous year. subject to the shareholders' approval of the appro- priation of results at the annual general meeting, the unappropriated profit available for distribution amounts to EUR 1,253 million (2019: EUR 1,646 million). as a percentage of group net profit, the dividend corresponds to a payout ratio of : 32.8 ()). financial and net assets position bmw ag balance

depreciation and amorti- sation amounted to EUR 2,646 million (2019: EUR 2,5()3 million). investments increased to EUR 3,826 million (2019: EUR 3,()62 million) mainly due to a contribution of EUR 88 mil- lion made to the capital reserves of bmw bank gmbh, munich. inventories decreased to EUR 5,()48 million (2019: EUR 5,994 million), mainly due to the lower level of finished goods held. receivables from subsidiaries rose to EUR 18,939 million (2019: EUR 16,698 million), mainly reflecting the higher level of intragroup trade receivables. the increase in other receivables and other assets to EUR 3,849 million (2019: EUR 3,513 million) was mainly attrib- utable to higher receivables from companies with which an investment relationship exists. the decrease in tax receivables had an offsetting effect. equity rose by EUR 86 million to EUR 15,165 million due to the transfer to other revenue reserves and the issue of shares of preferred stock in conjunction with the bmw ag's

EUR 3,615 million and included mainly amounts for services still to be performed relating to service and maintenance contracts. liquidity within the bmw group is ensured by means of a liquidity concept applied uniformly across the group. this involves concentrating a significant part of the group's liquidity at the level of bmw ag. an i am- portant instrument in this context is the cash pool based at bmw ag. the liquidity position reported by bmw ag therefore reflects the global activities of bmw ag and other group companies. outlook cash and cash equivalents increased by EUR 65 million to EUR 6,822 million, mainly due to surpluses from operating activities and cash inflows from marketable securities held as current assets. cash outflows from financing ac- tivities and investments in long-lived assets particularly had an offsetting effect. risks and opportunities bmw ag's performance is essentially dependent on the same set of risks and opportunities that affect the bmw group and which are described in detail in the report on outlook, risks and opportunities section of the combined management report. as a general rule, bmw ag participates in the risks entered into by group companies in proportion to the respective shareholding percentage. at the same time, the result on investments has a significant impact on the earnings of bmw ag. bmw ag is integrated in the group-wide risk management system and internal control system of the bmw group. further information is provided in the section internal control system relevant for accounting and financial reporting processes within the combined management report. for the financial year 2021, bmw ag expects a divi- dend payout ratio (unappropriated profit of bmw ag in accordance with hgb in relation to net profit for the year of the bmw group in accordance with ifrs) within a range of between 30 () and : 32.5 ()). due to its significance in the group and its close ties with group companies, expectations for bmw ag with respect to its non-financial performance indicators correspond largely to the bmw group's outlook. this is described in detail in the report on outlook, risks and opportunities section of the combined management report. the outlook for 2021 takes account of the expect- ed impact of the coronavirus pandemic. pricewaterhousecoopers gmbh wirtschaftspru- fungsgesellschaft, frankfurt am main, munich branch, has issued an unqualified audit opinion on the financial statements of bmw ag, of which the balance sheet and the income statement are presented here. the bmw ag financial statements for the financial year 2020 will be submitted to the operator of the electronic version of the german federal gazette and can be obtained via the company register website. these financial statements are available on the bmw group's website at bmw group combined management report report 2020 report on outlook, risks and opportunities 159 report on outlook, risks and opportunities outlook the bmw group's report on outlook, risks and opportunities presents the expected development in 2021, including the main risks and opportunities from the perspective of the group's management. in line with the group's internal management system, the outlook covers a period of one year. risks and opportunities are managed on the basis of a two-year assessment. the report on risks and opportunities therefore addresses a period of two years. the continuous forecasting process within the bmw group ensures that it is always ready to take ad- vantage of opportunities as they arise, but also to react appropriately to unexpected risks. the principal risks and opportunities are described in detail in the report on risks and opportunities. the matters discussed therein are relevant for all of the bmw group's key performance indicators and could result in variances between the outlook and actual outcomes. from the 2020 reporting year onwards, the outlook report will include the following key performance in- dicators in addition to existing ones: the proportion of women in management positions in the bmw group, the proportion of electrified ves to total deliveries and carbon emissions per ve produced. strategy, goals and management system. this is in line with the integrated approach used by bmw group to manage its business systematically on the basis of financial and sustainability targets. economic outlook according to the latest assessment of the internation- al monetary fund (imf), the global economy is projected to grow by 5.5 % in 2021. many countries are expected to continue implementing a comprehensive range of monetary and fiscal policy measures in 2021, in a bid to boost economies battered by the coronavirus pandemic. moreover, post-lockdown catch-up effects could generate additional momentum. ultimately, however, the actual growth rate will depend heavily on the success of the vac- cination campaigns now underway. potential new waves of the virus and its mutations pose an additional risk. further information on political and global economic report on risks and opportunities. risks is also provided in the the eurozone economy is projected to grow by around 4.3 % in 2021. the rate for germany, however, is likely to be somewhat lower (+ 3.6 %). the economic outlook for the other eurozone member states is very positive in some cases, with countries such as france (+ 5.6 %), italy (+ 4.6 %) and spain (+ 5.7 %) expected to post strong gdp growth over the forecast period. the performance of the uk economy in 2021 will not only depend on the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, but also on that of the trade and cooperation agreement reached with the eu. the latest projection for the uk economy is a growth rate of 4.6 %. the us economy is also projected to grow consider- ably by 4.8 % in 2021. the us federal reserve is likely to continue pursuing its low-interest-rate policies. at the same time, the stimulus packages announced by us president are expected to provide a boost to the economy. the japanese economy, which has also been severely affected by the pandemic, is projected to grow by 2.8 % in 2021. china was the only economy to expand slightly in 2020. with a projected rate of 8.4 %, the chinese econo- my is set to continue its growth course in 2021. currency markets currencies of particular importance for the interna- tional operations of the bmw group are the us dollar, the british pound, the chinese renminbi and the japa- nese yen. all of these major currencies are expected to be subject to a high degree of fluctuation in 2021. bmw group combined management report report 2020 report on outlook, risks and opportunities it seems reasonable to assume that the us federal reserve will continue its expansionary monetary policies in 2021. the usa's central bank may also be willing to allow inflation to run at a rate higher than 2 % in future, even over an extended period of time, thereby possibly leading to further depreciation of the us dollar against the euro. looking at the chinese renminbi, the close economic ties between the usa and china suggest that the cur- rencies of these two countries will develop more or less synchronously. the renminbi is expected to depreciate slightly against the euro in 2021. in 2021, the value of the british pound will be large- ly determined by the consequences of the agreement reached between the uk government and the eu. in view of the prevailing uncertainties, the exchange rate of the relatively weak pound is expected to move sideways over the course of 2021. the central bank in japan is unlikely to change its highly expansionary monetary policy in 2021. for this reason, the euro / yen exchange rate is also expected to remain more or less stable. the currencies of numerous emerging markets could come under pressure against the us dollar and the euro due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. this applies in particular to countries such as russia, brazil and india. 160 change in registrations % + 4.2 - 0.6 + 9.1 + 9.0 + 4.3 + 3.2 + 9.8 + 7.6 + 6.0 + 7.7 international automobile markets international automobile markets

to bounce back with a solid recovery. the market in china is set to grow sharply again in 2021. as in the past year, motorcycle market demand will continue to be influenced by the course of the pan- demic and its impact on the global economy in 2021. bmw group combined management report report 2020 report on outlook, risks and opportunities 161 international interest rate environment trade relations between the usa and china should improve under the new us administration, whilst still remaining strained. low inflation rates give central banks sufficient headroom to continue their expansion- ary monetary policies. (cid:43)owever, the rise in in(cid:193)ation rates since the beginning of the year, especially in the eurozone, indicates that consumer prices are also likely to increase again in the course of 2021. within the eurozone, the course of the pandemic and delays in the vaccine rollout suggest that the pathway back to normality could take some time yet. any further lockdowns during the first half of the year could damp- en economic growth and hold down inflation figures, potentially leaving the ecb with little flexibility to raise interest rates in 2021. the uk's economy is not expected to improve signif- icantly during the first quarter. following the initial suc- cess of the vaccination programme, the uk government is now looking to ease the lockdown on a cautious step- by-step basis. it remains to be seen, however, to what extent the virus mutation circulating there could because the situation to deteriorate again. in light of the fiscal and monetary policy measures taken by the government and the bank of england, the economy is not expected to see an upturn before the summer. it is therefore safe to assume that the bank of england will keep interest rates stable for the time being. in the usa, the house of representatives has ap- proved president 's 1.9 trillion dollar stimulus pack- age aimed at countering the impact of the pandemic on the economy. despite inflation being expected to rise in 2021, the federal reserve seems determined to continue its current programme of quantitative easing and leave the benchmark interest rate unchanged. the chinese central bank is expected to maintain an unchanged course. despite strained trade relations with the usa, economic growth in china is likely to gather additional pace in 2021. consequences for the bmw group future developments on international automobile markets also have a direct impact on the bmw group. challenges in the competitive environment as well as the course of the coronavirus pandemic are likely to have a significant impact on sales volumes. due to its global business model, the bmw group is well placed to capitalise on opportunities that present themselves, even at short notice. coordination between the group's sales and production networks also enables it to even out the impact of unforeseeable developments in various regions. moreover, investments in key future-oriented markets form a sound basis for further growth, while simultaneously strengthening the global presence of the bmw group. an unpredictable political environment may because actual economic growth in some regions to deviate from expected trends and developments. areas affected in this context include trade and customs policies, security and potential additional international trade conflicts. furthermore, risks continue to exist for upstream processes, including possible bottlenecks due to sup- ply shortages arising in regions that could become the focus of a pandemic. due to the high demand on inter- national semiconductor markets, there is currently an additional risk of bottlenecks in the supply of electronic components to production. risks and opportunities relating to purchasing the bmw group continues to observe these develop- ments and is ready to implement all necessary measures quickly and effectively. assumptions used in the outlook the report on outlook, risks and opportunities con- tains forward-looking statements. these are based on the bmw group's expectations and assessments and may be influenced by unforeseeable events. as a result, actual outcomes can deviate either positively or negatively from the expectations described below, among other things due to changes in the political and economic environ- ment as well as the further course of the coronavirus pandemic. report on risks and opportunities. bmw group combined management report report 2020 report on outlook, risks and opportunities 162 the following outlook relates to a forecast period of one year and is based on the composition of the bmw group during that time. the outlook takes account of all information available at the time of reporting and which could have an effect on the overall performance of the group. the expectations contained in the outlook are based on the bmw group's forecast for 2021 and reflect its most recent status. the basis for the preparation of and the principal assumptions used in the forecasts - which consider the consensual opinions of leading organisations, such as economic research institutes and banks - are set out below. the bmw group's outlook takes account of these assumptions. the coronavirus pandemic will continue to have an impact on business performance in 2021 and hence on the results of operations, financial position and net assets of bmw ag and the bmw group. due to the continuing uncertainty surrounding the course and potential conse- quences of the pandemic going forward, it is difficult to make an accurate forecast of the bmw group's business performance in 2021. for the forecast year 2021, the bmw group is working on the basis that the original widespread prevalence of the infection that was the dominant feature of 2020 will be replaced by recurrent, regional hotspots. the outlook has been therefore been drawn up on the assumption that, outside of hot spots, the overall incidence of infection can be controlled worldwide. the successive launch of vaccination cam- paigns and improved vaccine supply should also have an increasingly positive effect in 2021. uncertainties remain, however, as mutated strains of the virus emerge and spread, raising questions about the efficacy of currently available vaccines in combat- ting mutations. it is not possible to assess the extent to which such risks could impact the global economy, the financial markets and therefore the bmw group and, for this reason, they have not been taken into account in the outlook. with demand on international semiconductor mar- kets currently at a high level, the supply situation for electronic chips has become increasingly tense, which could result in supply bottlenecks affecting the availabili- ty of semiconductor components required for production. the bmw group is monitoring the situation closely. should the situation deteriorate further and significant supply bottlenecks occur, it cannot be ruled out that this will have an adverse impact on the outlook. the bmw group expects that the tensions between the usa and china will persist after the change in the us administration and remain a source of uncertainty. however, based on up-to-date assessments, customs tariffs are not expected to rise. current estimates and assumptions for the finan- cial year 2021, to the extent already known to the bmw group, have been taken into account and described in the outlook report. beyond these assessments, no fur- ther significant opportunities and risks are known or can be estimated at the present time. however, it cannot be ruled out that the assumptions underlying estimates may need to be changed over the course of the year. outlook for the bmw group overall assessment by group management despite the volatile situation brought about by the global spread of coronavirus, the bmw group expects business to develop positively and the risk situation to remain stable in the financial year 2021. new automobile and motorcycle models as well as individual mobili- ty-related services are expected to generate momentum. group profit before tax is therefore expected to rise significantly during the outlook period. the automotive segment is expected to record a solid year-on-year increase in the number of bmw, mini and rolls-royce brand ves delivered to customers. at the same time, the bmw group is targeting a further signif- icant reduction in carbon emissions in the new ve fleet (), calculated using the revised base (cid:230). in addition to improvements achieved through developments in highly efficient combustion engines, the expected reduction also reflects the significant increase in the forecast proportion of electrified ves sold. according to the planning, carbon emissions per ve produced are likely to fall moderately. the automotive segment's ebit margin is set to recover in 2021, most likely finishing within a range of 6 to 8 % and thus causing the segment to improve significantly. 1 eu

2.4 g / km. 7 the co2 fleet emissions figure of 99 g / km for the year 2020, as measured internally, is based on nedc and takes due account of permitted offsetting factors (phase-in, super-credits and eco-innovations). the co2 fleet emissions forecast for 2021 is based on wltp in accordance with legal requirements and includes fewer offsetting factors due to the fact that phase-in is no longer permitted for 2021 and the bmw group fully utilised the maximum amount of super-credits in 2020. for better comparability of the co2 fleet emissions forecast for 2021 and the fleet value for 2020, the 2020 figure has been converted internally from an nedc basis (including offsetting factors) to a wltp basis (excluding offsetting factors). the figure derived for 2020 serves only to enable reconciliation with the 2021 figure: it is not official and does not correspond to legislation that was in place in 2020. 8 from 2021, co2 emissions according to scope 1 and 2 include not only production emissions but also emissions at locations not allocated to production, , distribution centres, office buildings. bmw group combined management report report 2020 report on outlook, risks and opportunities 164 risks and opportunities overall assessment of the risk and opportunities situation organisation of risk management as a globally leading provider of premium automo- biles, motorcycles, mobility services and financial services, the bmw group is exposed to an array of un- certainties and changes. to ensure growth, profitability, efficiency and continued sustainability going forward, the bmw group needs to take well calculated risks and make full use of any opportunities that present themselves. the management of opportunities and risks is essen- tial in order to respond in an appropriate manner to any changes that occur in political, economic, technical or le- gal conditions. the bmw group has put a comprehensive risk management system in place to effectively with risks as they arise. the aim of the risk management system is to identify, assess and actively manage any risks that could threaten the attainment of the group's corporate targets. as part of that process, individual and cumulative risks capable of posing a threat to the profitability of the business are monitored and managed. all opportunities and risks expected to materialise have already been addressed in the outlook report. the following sections focus on potential future developments or events that could result in a positive (opportunity) or a negative deviation (risk) from the outlook for the bmw group. the assessment of the overall risk situation is based on a consolidated view of all significant individual risks. the overall risk situation for the bmw group has wors- ened moderately compared to one year earlier, reflecting - in the worst-case scenario - a significant deterioration in the global economic situation due to the coronavirus pandemic. the bmw group has already adjusted its sales and production planning to take account of expected macroeconomic developments and incorporated their impact in the outlook. should the effect of the pandemic prove less severe in 2021 and if the economy recovers more quickly than expected, opportunities for both rev- enues and earnings could arise. management does not see any threat to the bmw group's status as a going concern. similar to one year earlier, the current set of risks to the bmw group are considered manageable. if these risks - or opportu- nities - were to materialise, they could have an impact on underlying key performance indicators, thus causing deviations from the outlook. the bmw group's finan- cial resources are stable, with liquidity requirements currently covered by existing liquidity and available financing instruments. in addition to the risks described below, unforeseen events could have a negative impact on business opera- tions and hence on the bmw group's results of opera- tions, financial position and net assets as well as on its reputation. risk management is organised as a decentralised, group-wide network and steered by a centralised risk management function. every bmw group division is rep- resented by network representatives. this formal struc- ture reinforces the network's visibility and underlines the importance of risk management within the bmw group. the responsibilities and duties of the centralised risk management function and the network representatives are clearly documented and understood. significant risks reported from within the network are firstly presented for review to the risk management steering committee, which is chaired by group controlling. after review, any significant risks identified are reported to both the board of management and the supervisory board's audit committee. other functions such as compliance and human rights and internal control system serve as key interfaces to the risk the management system. in its capacity as an independent control body, corporate audit reviews the risk manage- ment system established by the board of management on an annual basis. bmw group combined management report report

compliance committee reporting / monitoring completeness controlling risk manage- ment steering committee supervisory board board of management measures group audit internal control system the bmw group utilises standardised methods to assess risks. all significant risks are measured using value-at-risk models and assessed on the basis of uni- form loss distribution metrics, thereby enabling better comparability of risks for both internal and external reporting purposes. the overall effect of risks on the results of operations, financial and net assets position is referred to in the following sections uniformly as \"earnings impact\". risks are classified both according to their potential impact on earnings (worst-case scenario) and according to the risk amount (average earnings impact, taking into account the probability of occurrence). the impact of risks is measured and reported net of any mitigation measures that are already taking effect (net basis). risks are measured over a two-year assessment period. according to group-wide guidelines, every employee and manager has a duty to report risks via the relevant reporting channels. the key elements of an effective risk culture are embedded in the bmw group's core values, in its risk management guidelines and in the risk strategy. new information and new requirements are continuous- ly fed into the bmw group's risk management system, thereby ensuring its ongoing development. training programmes and informational events are regularly con- ducted across the bmw group, particularly within the risk management network. these measures are essential ways of preparing those involved in the process to comply with any new or additional requirements. the risk management process applies across the entire group and comprises the early identification, analysis and assessment of risks, the coordinated use of appropriate management tools and the monitoring and evaluation of the measures taken. bmw group combined management report report 2020 report on outlook, risks and opportunities 166 the potential earnings impact in the worst-case sce- monitoring risk-bearing capacity nario is classified as follows: class low medium high potential earnings impact in a worst-case scenario > EUR 0 - 500 million > EUR 500 - 2,000 million > EUR 2,000 million the following criteria apply for the purpose of clas- sifying the risk amount: class low medium high risk amount > EUR 0 - 50 million > EUR 50 - 400 million > EUR 400 million the earnings impact of risks and opportunities is presented separately without offsetting. if no specific reference is made, opportunities and risks relate to the automotive segment. the scope of entities covered in the report on risks and opportunities corresponds to the scope of consolidated entities included in the bmw group financial statements. group-wide effects and trends can be identified by aggregating all significant risks at group level using value-at-risk models. for this purpose, the potential earnings impact of the risks (confidence level: 99 %) is aggregated, taking correlation effects into account. in or- der to assess the risk-bearing capacity of the bmw group, the aggregated amount of risks is compared with the risk cover amount (equity recognised for accounting purpos- es). a limit system for various risks helps monitor the risk-bearing capacity. managing non-financial risks as reported in the nfs alongside comprehensive risk management, sus- tainability constitutes a core strategic principle of the bmw group. risks resulting from sustainability issues are generally identified via the group-wide risk man- agement network. when analysing sustainability-related opportunities and risks, the physical risks associated with climate change ( of supply chains due to natural hazards) and transition risks (such as meeting emissions requirements) are also assessed. in accordance with SS 289 c of the german commer- cial code (hgb) risks that could have an impact on the non-financial aspects referred to in the act are reviewed as part of the reporting process. significant risks in this context are defined as those stemming from business activities, business relationships and products and / or services provided by the bmw group that are highly likely to have a seriously adverse impact. no significant non-financial risks were identified during the year under report. opportunities management a dynamic market environment also gives rise to op- portunities. identifying these opportunities is an integral part of the bmw group's strategic planning process. the group's range of products and services is continually reviewed on the basis of these analyses, resulting, for example, in new product projects being presented to the board of management for consideration. in order to compete successfully in the long term and at the same time effectively help play an active role in achieving the goal of climate neutrality - as called for by politicians and desired by society in general - the group's ve platforms are designed to operate flexibly with various types of drivetrain, enabling it to respond more swiftly to changing customer needs. the continuous monitoring of key business processes and strict cost controls are also essential for ensuring high levels of profitability and return on capital employed. once identified, opportunities are acted upon in the relevant operational areas on a decentralised basis. the importance of opportunities for the bmw group is classified on a qualitative basis in the categories \"signif- icant\" and \"insignificant\". probable measures aimed at increasing profitability are already incorporated in the outlook. bmw group combined management report report 2020 report

economic relations can have highly unpredictable effects. macroeconomic risks due to sales volume fluctuations could have a high earnings impact over the two-year assessment period. the risk amounts attached to macro- economic risks are classified as high. currently, the greatest risk for the global economy is the further spread and the consequences of the coro- navirus pandemic. considerable uncertainty remains regarding the dynamics of the coronavirus pandemic going forward, despite the current decline in infection figures. the situation is highly dependent on the pro- gress and success of the vaccination campaigns currently underway. it is not currently possible to predict with any degree of certainty the point in time from which a high vaccination rate could significantly mitigate the course of the pandemic. as a result, restrictions to public life and regional lockdowns are likely to be a continued source of uncertainty for consumers and weigh heavily on the sales situation across all markets. the bmw group is monitoring the situation on a continuous basis and tak- ing appropriate measures as required. bmw group combined management report report 2020 report on outlook, risks and opportunities 168 however, risks that existed prior to the outbreak of the pandemic still remain, despite being partially displaced in the public perception. the trade conflict between the usa and china is likely to be an enduring topic, despite the inauguration of the new us president. however, the focus could well shift from pure tariff increases to import and export restrictions on certain technologies. the po- tential introduction of further trade restrictions on both sides could have a significantly adverse impact on the bmw group's business operations due to less favourable conditions for importing ves. in the wake of ongoing climate change, natural disasters could occur more frequently and impact the bmw group in a variety of ways. for instance, economic activity in the affected regions could be negatively influ- enced. for consumers, this would mean a loss of income and the threat of unemployment and have a negative effect on sales. in the context of its \"adaptation to climate change\" project, the bmw group is preparing for numer- ous possible scenarios and has taken the step of systemat- ically integrating the reporting of opportunities and risks associated with climate change within this report. other risks to the economy include political instability in belarus, the conflict between armenia and azerbaijan, political unrest in the usa, the impact of the change in hong kong's status, and uncertainty regarding the sus- tainability of debt levels in some european countries. and its economic partners could result in significantly stronger sales volume growth, reduced competitive pressures and improved pricing. against this backdrop, macroeconomic opportunities capable of generating a sustainably positive impact on earnings are currently classi(cid:192)ed by the bmw group as signi(cid:192)cannot. strategic and sector-specific risks and oppor- tunities; changes in legislation and regulatory requirements the short-term introduction of more stringent legis- lation and regulations, particularly with regard to emis- sions, safety and consumer protection as well as regional, ve-related purchase and usage taxes, represents a significant risk for the automobile industry. country- and sector-specific trade barriers can also be subject to change at short notice. any sudden tightening of regula- tions in these areas could necessitate significantly higher investments and ongoing expenses or exert influence on customer behaviour. if the risk of market disruption due to unforeseeable short-term changes in legislation and regulations were to materialise, this could have a highly negative earnings impact over the two-year assessment period and beyond. the resulting risk amounts are there- fore classified as high. if the coronavirus is overcome with the help of ef- fective vaccines over the course of 2021, opportunities could arise for the bmw group in terms of revenues and earnings. significantly higher gdp growth in our strongest sales regions, positive signals in europe and the usa on the back of new economic stimulus packages, and a de-escalation of the trade conflict between the usa at present, the bmw group sees a continuous trend towards increasingly stringent ve emissions regula- tions, particularly for conventional drivetrain systems. the bmw group is addressing this risk primarily by sys- tematically electrifying its entire portfolio of brands and models: based on its existing plans, the bmw group will already have 25 electrified models on the road by 2023. at the same time, the group is pressing ahead with the continued development of highly efficient combustion engines in order to further reduce fuel consumption and emissions. additional risks could result from the tightening of existing import and export regulations, which could, in turn, lead primarily to additional expenses, but also complicate the import and export of ves and parts. changes in trade policies could also have a positive impact on the bmw group's earnings in the short to medium term. any reduction in tariff barriers, import restrictions or direct excise duties could result in lower manufacturing costs or enable products and services to be offered to customers at more attractive prices. further opportunities to improve the bmw group's earnings performance due to changes in legislation and regulatory requirements compared to the outlook are classified as insignificant. market developments apart from economic factors and sector-specific political conditions, increasingly fierce competition among established manufacturers and the emergence of new market competitors could also have effects that are difficult to predict. unforeseen consumer preferences and changes in brand perceptions can also give rise to both opportunities and risks. if market risks were to materialise, they could have a high earnings impact over the two-year assessment period. the risk amount is classified as high. bmw group combined management report report 2020 report on outlook, risks and opportunities 169 a potential further intensification in terms of com- petition could put pressure on sales volumes, selling prices and margins. for instance, the bmw group could be confronted with supply and demand distortions in the transition from conventionally powered ves to alternative drivetrain concepts, despite complying with legal requirements. customer behaviour can also alter due to changes in attitudes, values, environmental factors and fuel or energy prices. the flexibility of the bmw group's sales and production processes makes it possible to mitigate risks and take any opportunities arising in corresponding market and product segments. local product usage restrictions in specific sectors could have a limiting impact on the bmw group's sales in individual markets. in some urban areas, for instance, local measures have been, or are being, introduced, including entry restrictions, congestion charges or, in some situations, highly restrictive registration rules. these could influence local demand for the bmw group ves affected and hence have a negative impact on sales, margins and, possibly, the residual values of these ves. among other measures, the bmw group is ad- dressing this risk by broadening its range of electrified ves and mobility services. moreover, the bmw group continuously monitors its sales markets with the aim of increasing added value for customers and making the most of opportunities in terms of sales volume growth and pricing. the further development of the product and mobility portfolio as well as expansion in growth regions offer the greatest medium- to long-term growth opportunities for the bmw group. this depends above all on the group's ability to develop innovative products and services and bring them to market. if the negative impact of the cur- rent competitive situation is reduced more quickly than expected, additional opportunities are likely to arise for the bmw group. compared to the assumptions made in the outlook, the bmw group does not expect these opportunities to have a significant earnings impact over the two-year assessment period. risks and opportunities relating to operations risks and opportunities relating to production and technologies risks relating to production processes and fields of technology can lead to unplanned production interrup- tions or additional costs due to ve recalls. if any such risks were to materialise, they could have a high earnings impact over the two-year assessment period. the corresponding risk amounts are classified as high. potential causes of production downtimes include fires, infrastructural damage, machine and tooling break- downs, it malfunctions, temporary disruptions in utility supply or transportation and logistical disruptions, or the outbreak of a pandemic. all production units have a variety of measures in place to deal with potential pro- duction interruptions and downtimes, some of which are already integrated in the planning process and can be implemented operationally with a high degree of flexibil- ity. these measures have an effect on both the amount of damage and the probability of the risks occurring. technical fire protection, rapid response by on-site fire brigades and appropriate employee training are the key strategies for preventing and reducing any potential damage from fires. furthermore, policies are in place with insurance companies of high credit standing to cover the risk of fire-related events that lead to significant production interruptions at the group's or at suppliers' premises. the bmw group's successful business continuity management concept helps minimise downtimes in the event of a production stoppage and make up for lost production volumes as quickly as possible. flexible working time models and working time accounts designed to manage employee deployment, coupled with the ability to build individual ve mod- els or engine types with a high degree of flexibility at other bmw group plants as required, make a significant contribution to ensuring that fluctuations in demand can be met. detect-analyse-respond measures have been rolled out to counter the threat of targeted cyberattacks, re- flecting the fact that such attacks could because damage to production facilities, resulting in long downtimes and substantial losses. ves may be damaged or destroyed by natural hazards or other risks during transport from production plants to the sales regions. due to the growing number of major claims, deductible amounts included in trans- port insurance policies have risen significantly. in fact, as more and more insurance companies withdraw from this market segment, there is a risk that it could become economically unviable to take out insurance, as a result of which the bmw group would be required to bear the losses itself. bmw group combined management report report 2020 report on outlook, risks and opportunities 170 the bmw group recognises appropriate provisions for statutory and non-statutory warranty obligations. it cannot be ruled out, however, that additional costs arise in conjunction with ve recalls that are either not covered or not fully covered by provisions. despite thor- ough quality assurance processes, such risks can always arise if the materials and / or processing procedures used prove insufficient, in some cases years after a product is launched. further information on risks in conjunction with provisions for statutory and non-statutory warranty obligations is provided in note 33 to the group financial statements. the bmw group sees opportunities relating to production processes and fields of technology primarily in the competitive edge gained by mastering new and complex technologies. innovations in the technologies deployed and in it in general are driving the pace of digitalisation in production processes. given the long lead times involved in developing new products and processes, additional opportunities are not expected to have a significant earnings impact for the bmw group during the outlook period. risks and opportunities relating to purchasing purchasing risks relate primarily to supply risks caused by the failure of a supplier to deliver as well as to threats to bmw group-relevant know-how within the supplier network. production problems at supplier level could lead to consequences caused by increased expenditure for the bmw group due to production inter- ruptions and a corresponding reduction in ve sales. the bmw group deploys an extensive set of checks and proactive management measures to tackle the challenges currently facing the automotive supply industry. if pur- chasing risks were to materialise, they could have a high earnings impact over the two-year assessment period. the risk amount attached to purchasing risks is classified as high. close cooperation between carmakers and suppliers in the development and production of ves and the provision of services generates economic benefits, but also raises levels of dependency. potential reasons for the failure of individual suppliers to deliver include, in particular, it-related risks, non-compliance with sus- tainability or quality standards and the occurrence of natural hazards and fires. insufficient financial capacity on the part of individual suppliers could also jeopardise supplies to production plants. in this context, additional countermeasures have been put in place in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. moreover, any major deterioration of a particular country's national security situation is incorporated in the risk measurement process as a potential reason for the failure of a value and / or supply chain. any risks potentially arising for individual suppliers and / or entire supply chains in conjunction with the need to adapt to the consequences of climate change are continually as- sessed on the basis of in-house expert knowledge, taking scientific findings into due account. the growing complexity of the supplier network, par- ticularly in the case of sub-suppliers whose operations can only be indirectly monitored by the bmw group, is a further potential because of downtimes at supplier loca- tions. for instance, there is a risk that strong demand on international semiconductor markets gives rise to bottlenecks in the supply of electronic components for production. the increased threat of cyberattacks along the entire value chain also affects supply security as well as the ability to protect know-how relevant to the bmw group. to ensure a uniform level of it security for all those involved along the value and supply chain, the bmw group impresses on suppliers the importance of obtaining appropriate it security certification. by monitoring and developing global supplier mar- kets, the bmw group continuously strives to become more competitive by working together with the world's best product and service providers. as part of its supplier preselection process, the bmw group checks for com- pliance with the sustainability standards established for its supplier network. this includes due consideration of and compliance with internationally recognised human rights and applicable labour and social standards. the level of carbon emissions generated by prospec- tive suppliers is taken into account as an independent criterion when processing tenders and awarding new contracts. this approach ensures that first-tier suppliers regard the issue of carbon emissions - alongside other factors - as relevant for their business and, in turn, set targets for other supply chain levels in which they are involved. the aim is to reduce carbon emissions across all relevant supply chains on the basis of constructive cooperation with suppliers. it is important to point out, however, that the bmw group depends on receiving accurate information from suppliers in this regard. furthermore, fire risks at series suppliers are eval- uated by means of questionnaires and selective on-site inspections. suppliers are required to implement the necessary measures on a continuous basis. following evaluation, the results are fed back into the process for awarding contracts for new projects. bmw group combined management report report 2020 report on outlook, risks and opportunities 171 the risks associated with the supply of raw materials are mitigated either by reducing the use of raw materials or substituting them with alternative products. within the purchasing and supplier network, oppor- tunities arise above all in the area of global sourcing and the associated efficiency improvements. making optimal use of any innovations developed by suppliers is a key prerequisite for developing future-oriented mobility prod- ucts and services. similarly, favourable location-related cost factors, in particular those arising due to the close proximity of supplier structures to new and existing bmw group production plants as well as the introduc- tion of innovative production technologies, could lead to lower cost of materials for the bmw group. one of the bmw group's aims is to have battery cells manufactured in europe. key prerequisites for achieving this aim, however, are primarily further advances in the development of battery cell technology and the mastery of cell production processes. contracts have been con- cluded with various suppliers as part of the group's elec- trification strategy. a further source of opportunities is seen in the possible integration of previously unidentified supplier-driven innovations in the group's product range. the bmw group offers innovative suppliers numerous options for creating specific contractual arrangements that promote companies developing innovative solutions. compared to the assumptions made in the outlook, the bmw group does not expect such additional oppor- tunities to have a significant earnings impact over the two-year assessment period. risks and opportunities relating to the sales network in order to sell its products and services, the bmw group operates a global sales network mainly com- prising independent dealerships, branches, subsidiaries and importers. in addition, a pilot project to promote direct sales was launched in south africa in 2020. any threat to the continued activities of parts of the sales network, for example due to the impending insolvency of a dealership, would entail risks for the bmw group. the occurrence of sales and marketing risks would have only a low earnings impact over the two-year assessment period. the risk amount is classified as low. new developments in the field of digital communica- tion and connectivity provide new opportunities for the bmw group's brands to take advantage of additional sales channels in their efforts to bring new products to market. based on ve-driven telematics data, custom- ers can elect to use a specific service and actively consent to the relevant data being transferred. the service provid- ers contracted to perform the work receive the necessary data via the bmw group's secure back end system. the information forms the basis for customised, data-driven, innovative service options. additional oppor tunities could arise if new sales channels contribute to greater brand reach to customer groups than currently envisaged in the outlook. compared to the assumptions made in the outlook, the bmw group does not expect these opportunities to have a significant earnings impact over the two-year assessment period. information security, data protection and it the advance of digitalisation throughout all areas of the business world places considerable demands on the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronical- ly processed data and the associated use of information technology (it). alongside higher threat levels in this area, regulatory requirements worldwide relating to the use of personal data are becoming increasingly stringent, for example due to the california consumer privacy act. if risks relating to information security, data protection and it were to materialise, they could have a high earnings impact over the two-year assess- ment period. despite extensive security measures and constant efforts to ensure compliance with applicable data protection legislation, the risk amount in this area is classified as high. in addition to cyberattacks and direct physical inter- vention, there is a risk that either a lack of knowledge or misconduct on the part of employees could also pose a danger to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information, data and systems. the main direct con- sequences could range from negative effects on revenues due to the misuse of information through to disruption in the production of components or ves. a further indirect consequence could be reputational damage. the bmw group places great emphasis on protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of informa- tion from unauthorised access or misuse, whether relat- ing to business, employees or customers. data security is an integral part of all group business processes and practised in accordance with the / iec 2()001 inter- national standard. in conjunction with risk management requirements, risks relating to information security, data protection and it are systematically documented, allocat- ed appropriate measures by the departments concerned and continuously monitored with regard to threat level and risk mitigation. regular analyses and controls as well as rigorous security management policies ensure an appropriate level of security. bmw group combined management report report 2020 report on outlook, risks and opportunities 172 however, despite continuous testing and preventive security measures, it is impossible to eliminate risks com- pletely in this area. all group employees are required to treat information such as confidential business, customer and employee data with care, use information systems se- curely and handle risks in a transparent manner. group- wide requirements are documented in a comprehensive set of principles, guidelines and instructions, such as, for example, the privacy corporate rules for handling per- sonal data. regular communication, awareness-raising and training measures form the basis for a high level of security and risk awareness. with regard to cooperations and business partnerships, the bmw group protects its intellectual property as well as its customer and employee data by issuing clearly defined instructions on informa- tion security, data protection and the use of information technology. trade secrets and sensitive personal data are subject to particularly stringent security measures. technical data protection incorporates industry-wide standards and good practices. responsibility for informa- tion security and data protection for each group entity lies with either the board of management or the relevant management team. with the advance of digitalisation, the bmw group is continually improving the customer experience in its existing lines of business. at the same time, new busi- ness segments are emerging, which have only become feasible due to innovation in the field of information technology. the development and provision of digital ser- vices for customers, increased ve connectivity and automated driving solutions are opening up new oppor- tunities. via bmw connecteddrive and bmw cardata, the range of services and apps on offer to customers is constantly being expanded and updated. compared to the assumptions made in the outlook, the bmw group does not expect these opportunities to have a significant earnings impact over the two-year assessment period. financial risks and risks relating to the use of financial instruments currency risks and opportunities as an internationally operating enterprise, the bmw group conducts business in a variety of currencies, thus giving rise to currency risks and opportunities. a substantial portion of group revenues, purchasing and funding occur outside the eurozone, particularly in china and the usa. regularly updated cash-flow-at-risk models and scenario analyses are used to measure currency risks and opportunities. if currency risks were to materialise, they could be associated with a high earnings impact over the two-year assessment period. the risk amount relating to currency risks is classified as high. the risk assessment is therefore slightly less favourable than one year earlier, due to the increased volatility of individual currencies in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. significant opportunities can arise if currency developments are favourable for the bmw group. operational currency management is based on the re- sults of currency risk analyses. the bmw group manages currency risks at both strategic (medium to longterm) and operational level (short to mediumterm). medium- to long-term measures include increasing production and purchase volumes in foreign currency regions, nat- ural hedging. currency risks are managed in the short to medium term and for operational purposes by means of hedging on financial markets. the principal objective is to increase planning reliability for the bmw group. hedging transactions are entered into only with finan- cial partners of good credit standing. opportunities are also secured through the use of options during specific market phases. risks and opportunities relating to raw materials prices as a large-scale manufacturing company, the bmw group is exposed to purchase price risks, par- ticularly in relation to the raw materials used in ve production. the analysis of raw materials price risks is based on planned purchases of raw materials and com- ponents containing those products. cash-flow-at-risk models and scenario analyses are used to measure risks and opportunities relating to raw materials prices. if such risks were to materialise, they could have a medium earnings impact over the two-year assessment period. the risk amount is classified as medium. signif- icant opportunities could arise if raw materials prices develop favourably for the bmw group. changes in prices are monitored via a well-defined management process, the primary objective of which is to increase planning reliability for the bmw group. price fluctuations for precious metals (platinum, palladium, rhodium), nonferrous metals (aluminium, copper), raw materials for batteries (lead, nickel, cobalt) and, to some extent, for steel and its basic ingredients (iron ore, coking coal) as well as energy (gas, electricity) are hedged using financial derivatives and supply contracts with fixed pricing arrangements. bmw group combined management report report 2020 report on outlook, risks and opportunities 173 the bmw group holds equity investments of varying amounts in numerous entities, which could result in risk from depreciation and amortisation. if other financial risks were to materialise, they could have a medium earnings impact over the two-year as- sessment period. the risk amount associated with other financial risks is classified as medium. revaluations of investments could give rise to opportunities with a significant earnings impact. risks and opportunities relating to pension obligations future pension obligations are financed largely via external pension funds or trust constructs that are le- gally separate from bmw. externally managed funds are invested on capital markets in a broadly diversified port- folio with a view to enabling future pension payments to be disbursed out of pension assets. these arrangements greatly reduce the need to fund pension payments out of ongoing operations. liquidity risks the major part of the financial services segment's credit financing and leasing business is refinanced on capital markets. liquidity risks can arise in the form of rising refinancing costs or from restricted access to funds as a consequence of the general market situation. if liquidity risks were to materialise, they would be likely to have a medium earnings impact over the two-year assess- ment period. the risk amount associated with liquidity risks, including the risk of the bmw group's rating being downgraded, is classified as medium. the year-on-year change in the assessment of the risk amount reflects the sharp short-term rise in refinancing costs on capital markets at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. based on the experience gained during the global financial crisis, a liquidity concept has been drawn up, which is rigorously adhered to and continuously devel- oped. the concept has been recently updated to take account of the implications of the coronavirus pandemic. the use of the \"matched funding principle\" to finance the financial services segment's operations ensures that liquidity risks are generally avoided. furthermore, scenarios have been calculated to present and analyse the potential impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the matched funding principle. solvency is assured at all times throughout the bmw group by adhering to liquidity ratios and using a broadly diversified range of refinancing sources. regular measurement and monitoring ensure that cash inflows and outflows for the various maturities and currencies offset one another. this approach is an integral part of the bmw group's liquidity concept. the liquidity position is monitored continuously and managed through the group-wide planning of financial requirements and funding. the diversified refinancing strategy employed reduces dependency on financial instruments and markets. moreover, the bmw group's solid financial and earnings position results in high credit ratings from internationally recognised rating agencies. at present, opportunities relating to liquidity are not expected to have any significant earnings impact. further information on risks in conjunction with fi- note 39 to the group nancial instruments is provided in financial statements. other financial risks other financial risks worth mentioning include coun- terparty risks as well as those arising in connection with investments in other entities. the bmw group works together with banks to en- sure that the available liquidity is optimally invested and to hedge against financial market risks (particularly cur- rency, commodity and interest rate risks) using derivative financial instruments. counterparty risk describes the risk that the bmw group will not receive the payments due to it in connection with the investment and hedging transactions referred to above. an enhanced value-at-risk model is employed to measure counterparty risk, taking into account the creditworthiness (rating) of the banks and the business volumes involved. risk is managed using a limit system, which includes daily monitoring of the extent to which limits are being utilised. bmw group combined management report report 2020 report on outlook, risks and opportunities 174 risks arise from fluctuations in pension obligations on the one hand and the related pension assets on the other. opportunities arise if the value of pension assets on capital markets develops favourably or if pension obligations decrease at a more pronounced rate than the related assets. pension obligations are primarily measured using a discount rate based on market yields from high-quality corporate bonds. these yields are subject to market fluctuations and therefore influence the level of pension obligations. changes in other parameters, such as rising inflation rates and longer life expectancy, also impact the amount as well as the duration of future pension payments. regulatory requirements or changes may also affect the amount of pension obligations. the fluctuation of pension assets reflects the vola- tility of individual asset classes on capital markets. the broadly diversified portfolio comprises investments in interest-bearing securities, equities, real estate and other asset classes. despite the high level of external funding, risks re- lating to pension obligations could have a high earnings impact over the two-year assessment period. the risk amounts attached to pension obligations are classified as high. the strategic portfolio allocation of pension assets therefore comprises two key components. one part is al- located with a view to hedging against value fluctuations, applying the \"liability-driven investment approach\", whereby capital market instruments are employed on a targeted basis to hedge against financial risks arising from the measurement of pension obligations. a second part is allocated with a view to generating income. within a favourable capital market environment, this part of the pension assets offers the opportunity to further reduce pension plan deficits by generating positive returns and thereby impact the bmw group's financial position to a significant degree. the risks and opportunities described above are continuously monitored and managed. remeasurements on the liability and asset sides are recognised net of deferred taxes through other compre- hensive income and hence directly in equity (within revenue reserves). further information on risks in conjunction with note 32 to the group pension provisions is provided in financial statements. legal risks the bmw group is exposed to various legal risks, not least due to the global nature of its operations. legal risks may result from non-compliance with laws or other legal requirements or from legal disputes with business partners or other market participants. if legal risks were to materialise, they could have a high earnings impact over the two-year assessment period. the risk amounts attached to significant identified legal risks are classified as medium. however, it cannot be ruled out that new legal risks, as yet unforeseen, materialise that could have a high earnings impact for the bmw group. the growing globalisation of the bmw group's operations as well as of business interdependencies in general, combined with the variety and complexity of legal provisions - increasingly including import and export regulations - give rise to a greater risk of non-compliance with applicable law. a compliance man- agement system is in place across the bmw group to ensure that its representative bodies, executives and staff members worldwide consistently act in a lawful manner. in 2020, the system was further developed, primarily by establishing additional compliance functions in various centralised departments within bmw ag, stepping up face-to-face training on antitrust compliance and via a group-wide \"tone from the top\" communication initi- ative that reflects the compliance management culture within the bmw group. corporate governance like all entities with international operations, the bmw group is confronted with legal disputes, alleged claims (particularly relating to warranties and product liability or intellectual property rights infringements) and proceedings initiated by government agencies. any of these could, amongst other consequences, have an adverse impact on the group's reputation. such pro- ceedings are typical for the sector, may result as a con- sequence of realigning product or purchasing strategies to changed market conditions or are antitrust-related. particularly in the us market, class action lawsuits and product liability risks can have substantial financial con- sequences and because damage to the group's reputation. more rigorous application or interpretation of existing regulations or the introduction of new regulations could result in a greater number of recalls. bmw group combined management report report 2020 report on outlook, risks and opportunities 175 was not involved that consumers are generally obliged to pay a compensation after a successful withdrawal. since the beginning of 2020, several references for a prelim- inary ruling on the scope of information obligations have been filed with the european court of justice (ecj). on the basis of these requests, there is a risk that bmw bank's prospects of success in the withdrawal lawsuits could deteriorate in the event of negative future ecj case law. the possible financial impact cannot be definitively assessed at this stage. the bmw group recognises appropriate levels of pro- vision for lawsuits. in addition, a part of these risks is in- sured to an economically reasonable extent. further risks from legal proceedings are reported as other contingent liabilities. it cannot be ruled out, however, that damages arise that are either not covered or not fully covered by insurance policies or provisions or reported as contingent liabilities. in accordance with ias 37 (provisions, con- tingent liabilities and contingent assets), the required information is not provided if the bmw group concludes that its disclosure could seriously prejudice the outcome of the relevant legal proceedings. further information on contingent liabilities is provided in note 38 to the group financial statements. in an antitrust investigation, the eu commission al- leges that five german car manufacturers colluded with the aim of restricting competition for innovation with regard to certain exhaust treatment systems for diesel- and petrol-driven passenger ves. the current investi- gation is solely concerned with possible infringements of competition law. the eu commission is not alleging that the bmw group conducted a deliberate and unlawful ma- nipulation of the emissions control system. the statement of objections leads the bmw group to believe that it is probable (\"more likely than not\") that the commission will issue a significant fine. a provision of approximately EUR 1.4 billion was recognised in 2019 in accordance with international financial reporting standards for negative financial impacts that cannot yet be definitively assessed. in december 2019 the bmw group submitted a detailed reply to the statement of objections. the eu commis- sion is currently examining the reply and, on that basis, will determine the next procedural steps. therefore, the financial impact cannot yet be definitively assessed. for several years, lawsuits have been filed against bmw bank gmbh (bmw bank) in which consumers claim the withdrawal of their loan and leasing contracts on the basis of allegedly incorrect and insufficient pre-contractual information. the focus is on loan con- tracts. since 2017, bmw bank has won the vast majority of these lawsuits. in november 2019, the federal court of justice (bgh) adopted a decision of principle in favour of bmw bank, confirming the accuracy of consumer-rel- evant information in loan contracts. in addition, in octo- ber 2020 the bgh decided in a case in which bmw bank bmw group combined management report report 2020 report on outlook, risks and opportunities 176 risk management system in the financial services segment in the financial services segment, the risk manage- ment process also takes financial regulatory require- ments such as basel iii into account. internal methods for identifying, measuring, managing and monitoring risks within the financial services segment comply with national and international standards. risk management within the financial services business is built on the prevailing risk culture, the defined risk strategy, the internal capital adequacy assessment process framework and a set of rules comprising principles and guidelines. in organisational terms, the risk management process is ensured by means of a clear division between front- and back-office activities and a comprehensive internal control system. the main tool used to manage risk within the financial services segment is to ensure the segment's risk-bearing capacity. all risks - in the sense of unexpected losses - must be covered at all times. based on the entity's risk ap- petite, this is achieved by ensuring specified levels of risk-covering assets (asset cushions) in the form of equity capital. unexpected losses are measured using various value-at-risk models, which are validated at regular in- tervals. risks are also aggregated after taking account of correlation effects. in addition to assessing the group's ability to bear risk, stress scenarios are also examined. the segment's risk-bearing capacity is also regularly monitored by means of an integrated limit system for the various risk categories. sustainability has developed into a megatrend of our time and is increasingly becoming the focus of political and social debate. both the effects of climate change and the changes brought about by the fight against climate change are also likely to be reflected across the world's financial system. due to the potential macroeconomic consequences, the related sustainability risks are seen as a threat to the stability of financial markets. in the context of bank supervision at national and international level, it is therefore essential that the banks concerned take sustainability risks adequately into account. the financial services segment not only helps its customers to satisfy their mobility needs by offering credit financing and leasing products, it also promotes the bmw group's industrial business from a sales point of view. the far-reaching consequences of the debate on sustainability and sustainability risks affect both the non-financial economy (and therefore the bmw group) and the financial economy (and therefore the financial services segment). due to the close interrelationships within the group, developments that affect the bmw group's industrial business in the first step ( driving bans, adjustments to carbon emissions targets, the growing proportion of e-ves, etc.) are also relevant for the financial services segment in the second step. this environment has always been part of the underlying framework of the financial services segment's business model. the growing challenges posed by climate change and the resulting impact on the financial system are taken into account in the financial services segment by adequately addressing sustainability risks. as an inte- gral part of the bmw group's value chain, the financial services segment is highly aware of the importance of managing sustainability risks and is therefore fully inte- grated in the bmw group's comprehensive sustainable corporate strategy. the following overview provides a general summary of the main risks and opportunities in the financial services segment: risks opportunities classification of risk amount change compared to prior year classification change compared to prior year risks and opportunities risks and opportunities relating to the provision of financial services credit risk residual value interest rate changes operational risks medium high medium medium stable stable stable stable insignificant significant significant - stable stable stable - bmw group combined management report report 2020 report on outlook, risks and opportunities 177 residual value risks and opportunities relating to the financial services segment risks and opportunities arise in conjunction with leasing contracts if the market value of a leased ve at the end of the contractual term of a lease differs from the residual value estimated at the commencement date of the lease. a residual value risk exists if the expected market value of the ve at the end of the contractual term is lower than its estimated residual value at the date the contract is entered into. if unexpected residual value risks were to materialise, they could have a high earnings impact from the group's perspective over the two-year assessment period. a high earnings impact would then arise for the affected financial services and automotive segments. the risk amount is classified as high for the group as a whole. opportunities can arise out of a pos- itive deviation between the actual market value and the original residual value forecast. the bmw group classi- fies potential residual value opportunities as significant. risks and opportunities relating to the financial services segment the main categories of risk relevant for the finan- cial services segment are credit and counterparty risk, residual value risk, interest rate risk, operational risk and liquidity risk. the evaluation of liquidity risk for the financial services segment is included in the liquidity risk category for the group as a whole. during the financial year 2020, the aggregate risk cushion for risks in the financial services segment was sufficient at all times, thereby ensuring the segment's risk-bearing capacity. credit and counterparty risks and opportunities relating to the financial services segment credit and counterparty default risk arises within the financial services segment if a contractual partner (e. g. a customer or dealership) becomes either unable or only partially able to fulfil its contractual obligations, so that lower income is generated or losses are incurred. if unexpected credit and counterparty default risks were to materialise, they could have a medium earnings impact over the two-year assessment period. the risk amount is classified as medium. the bmw group classifies poten- tial opportunities in this area as insignificant. in light of the uncertainties surrounding the future course of the coronavirus pandemic, additional credit loss provisions were recognised during the financial year 2020 for expected credit losses, in order to reflect the possible negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic on retail customer and dealership business for accounting purposes. initial and continuous creditworthiness testing is an important aspect of the bmw group's credit risk man- agement system. for this reason, every borrower's cred- itworthiness is tested for all credit financing and leasing contracts entered into by the bmw group. opportunities may arise if the managed portfolio performs better over time than estimated when the credits were granted. the intensive management of purchasing processes and col- lateral assessment as well as favourable macroeconomic developments could accentuate these opportunities. in the case of retail customer financing, creditworthiness is assessed using validated scoring systems integrated in the purchasing process. in the area of dealership financ- ing, creditworthiness is assessed by means of ongoing credit monitoring and an internal rating system that takes account not only of the material credit standing of the borrower, but also of qualitative factors such as past reliability in business relationships. changes in the cred- itworthiness of customers arising during the credit term are covered by risk provisioning procedures. the credit risk of individual customers is quantified on a monthly basis and, depending on the outcome, taken into account within the risk provisioning system. macroeconomic developments are currently subject to a higher degree of volatility. if developments are more favourable than assumed in the outlook, credit losses may be reduced, leading to a positive earnings impact. due to the coronavirus pandemic, moratoria were granted to customers and dealers, particularly during the first six months of the year, taking into account the prevailing legal requirements. the simultaneous i am- provement in the economic situation in most markets in the second half of the year meant that the low percentage of actual loan defaults was kept stable. bmw group combined management report report 2020 report on outlook, risks and opportunities 178 each ve's estimated residual value is calculated on the basis of historical external and internal data. this estimation provides the expected market value of the ve- at the end of the contractual period. developments on pre-owned car markets are an important factor for the bmw group. in 2020, the number of electrified ves also continued to increase. changes in the value of these ves are largely determined by a set of known influ- encing factors. prices on pre-owned car markets in the premium segment fluctuated within the usual range and were even favourably influenced in some cases by coro- navirus-related catch-up effects. as part of the manage- ment of residual value risks, the net present value of risk costs is also calculated at the contract commencement date. market developments are monitored throughout the contractual period and the risk assessment updated accordingly. residual value risk management essentially follows the same established process, regardless of the drivetrain variant. based on current expectations of a rising level of re- sidual value losses in subsequent years, the level of risk provisioning has been raised in the form of additional provisions and in line with applicable financial reporting standards. accordingly, risk costs for residual value risks in the financial services segment are significantly higher than one year earlier. interest rate risks and opportunities relating to the financial services segment operational risks relating to the financial services segment interest rate risks in the financial services segment relate to potential losses caused by changes in market interest rates. these can arise when fixed interest rate periods do not match for assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet. if interest rate risks were to mate- rialise, they could have a medium earnings impact over the two-year assessment period. the risk amount is clas- sified as medium. favourable interest rate developments compared to the outlook represent opportunities that the bmw group classifies as significant. interest rate risks in the financial services business are managed by ensuring that fixed interest rate periods match to a large extent and through the use of interest-rate derivatives. if the relevant recognition criteria are fulfilled, derivatives used by the bmw group are accounted for as hedging relationships. further information on risks in conjunc- tion with financial instruments is provided in note 39 to the group financial statements. in the financial services segment, operational risks are defined as the risk of losses arising as a consequence of the unsuitability or failure of internal procedures (process risks), people (personnel-related risks), systems (infrastructure- and it-related risks) and external events (external risks). the recording and measurement of risk scenarios, loss events and countermeasures in the op- erational risk management system provide the basis for the systematic analysis and management of potential or materialised operational risks. annual self-assessments are also carried out. this risk category also includes sustainability risks that correspond to the definition of operational risks, such as external events or natural and man-made disasters. if operational risks were to materialise, they would be likely to have a low earnings impact over the two-year as- sessment period. the risk amount is classified as medium. at present, no significant opportunities for the earnings situation are seen with regard to operational risks. bmw group combined management report report 2020 internal control system relevant for accounting and financial reporting processes 179 * internal control system relevant for accounting and financial report- ing processes the internal control system relevant for accounting and financial reporting processes has the task of en- suring that accounting and financial reporting of the bmw group is both accurate and reliable. within the framework of the \"three lines of defence\" model used to manage risk across the group, the internal control system represents a key component of the second line of defence, serving as a link between the operating units, the corporate audit function and the external auditors. internationally recognised standards for internal control systems were taken into account when designing the various components of the bmw group's internal control system. the system comprises: -- group-wide mandatory accounting guidelines -- controls integrated in processes and it systems -- organisational measures incorporating the principles of the risk-oriented segregation of duties -- process-independent monitoring measures the system and the methodologies applied are sub- ject to continuous improvement, with system effective- ness assessed regularly on the basis of centralised and decentralised process analyses, analyses of data within the various financial systems and audit procedures. the principal features of the internal control system, as far as they relate to individual entity and group accounting and financial reporting processes, are described below. guidelines for recognising, measuring and allocating items to accounts are available to all group employees via the intranet. new accounting standards are assessed for their impact on the bmw group's accounting and financial reporting. accounting guidelines and processes are reviewed continuously and revised at least once a year, or more frequently if required. preventive and detective controls are integrated in group accounting and financial reporting processes. preventive controls serve to prevent errors and omis- sions, whereas detective controls serve to detect and correct errors. to the extent possible, they are designed to comply with the principle of the segregation of duties. key it systems that are relevant for accounting and fi- nancial reporting incorporate controls designed, among other things, to prevent business transactions from being recorded incorrectly as well as to ensure the timely rec- ognition and measurement of all business transactions in accordance with applicable requirements. controls are also in place to test the appropriateness of consolidation procedures. * disclosures pursuant to sections 289 and 315 hgb. in conjunction with the ongoing development of it systems relevant for accounting and financial report- ing processes at both individual entity and group level, controls are adapted to take account of new requirements and opportunities arising as a result of advances in infor- mation technology. moreover, the bmw group uses data analysis tools to identify and subsequently eliminate any weaknesses in the control system. responsibilities for ensuring the effectiveness of the internal control system in group accounting and financial reporting processes are clearly defined and allocated to the relevant line and process managers. these managers report annually on their assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control system for accounting and financial reporting purposes. the assess- ment also includes the results of internal and external audits as well as of data analysis that is conducted on a continual basis. in this context, the group's various units confirm the effectiveness of the internal control system for accounting and financial reporting. the results of the assessment are gathered and documented with the aid of appropriate tools. any weaknesses in the control system are eliminated, taking into
