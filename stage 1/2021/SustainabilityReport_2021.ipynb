    "The \"content\" column, containing the text of the reports, undergoes a series of cleaning, normalization, and preprocessing steps to ensure accurate and efficient analysis. These steps include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* String conversion: Converting the input to a string format ensures consistency and compatibility during subsequent processing tasks.\n",
    "* Lowercase conversion: Transforming all text to lowercase serves as a simple normalization step, reducing the complexity and variability of the input data.\n",
    "* Unicode decoding: Removing diacritics (e.g., accented characters) and normalizing the text encoding mitigates potential discrepancies arising from different encoding formats.\n",
    "* URL and email address removal: Eliminating URLs and email addresses reduces noise in the dataset, as these elements do not contribute valuable information for the analysis.\n",
    "* Extra whitespace removal: Eradicating extra whitespaces improves text analysis and tokenization by ensuring that only meaningful spaces are retained.\n",
    "* Contact detail removal: Excluding phone numbers, contact person strings, and social media references further minimizes noise in the dataset, honing the focus on relevant text.\n",
    "* Table of contents removal: Discarding the table of contents enhances the data quality by eliminating repetitive and non-essential information.\n",
    "* Named entity removal: Employing the spaCy model to remove human names and other named entities optimizes the text for analysis and modeling by concentrating on pertinent content.\n",
    "* Abbreviation expansion: Utilizing the contractions library and custom functions with regular expressions, common and uncommon abbreviations are expanded to improve text interpretation.\n",
    "* Special character elimination: Excluding all special characters, except punctuation, refines the input data. Retaining punctuation is necessary for accurate sentence tokenization and removed after sentence tokenization..\n",
    "* Tokenization and lemmatization: Tokenizing words and sentences, and subsequently lemmatizing words using the WordNetLemmatizer from nltk, streamlines the text and reduces morphological variations.\n",
    "* Stopword removal: Customizing the nltk stopwords list by adding or removing specific stopwords enables more precise and tailored text analysis.\n",
    "* Part-of-speech (POS) tagging: Assigning POS tags to words and sentences enhances the text representation by providing additional linguistic information, which may be beneficial for subsequent analysis and modeling tasks.\n",
    "* Sentiment Analysis: Basic sentiment value calculation on the tokenzued sentences to get first insights im terms of the sentiments in the reports within the EDA."
